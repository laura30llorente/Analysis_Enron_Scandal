# Analysis_Enron_Scandal

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project consists of internal emails exchanged by Enron employees.

## Introduction
This project analyzes the **Enron case** by examining a dataset containing internal emails sent among Enron employees. The study focuses on uncovering hidden connections, relationships and potential organizational hierarchies that may have played a role in the company’s downfall.

Through the use of **social network analysis (SNA)**, this project aims to provide insights into how communication flowed within the organization, identifying key influencers, central figures, and possible hierarchical structures. The analysis helps us understand internal dynamics that might have contributed to Enron's crisis.

## Social Network Analysis (SNA)
In this analysis, SNA was used to map the email exchanges between Enron employees. 
SNA techniques helped visualize the complex web of interactions, revealing potential influence points and central figures who played significant roles within the organization.

## Jeff Skilling Analysis
One key figure in my analysis was Jeff Skilling, Enron's CEO, who played a central role in steering the company during the period leading up to its collapse. Skilling’s influence on the internal communication network was significant, and examining his role in the email exchanges gave me deeper insights into his decision-making processes and leadership style.
My analysis of Skilling’s communications motivated me to further research the Enron case, the consequences for the employees, and the prison sentences for those involved in the corruption, including Skilling himself. 

## Analysis of Late 2001
In the final part of my research, I chose to focus specifically on the last months of 2001, a period that revealed fascinating insights. Upon analyzing emails from this time, I was struck by the clear signs of crisis within the company. These communications reflected the concerns of employees, as well as the measures and action plans that were being considered to navigate the escalating situation. The emails captured the urgency and the growing awareness among staff of the company's impending collapse, making it a critical period to study in depth.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**: To analyze and visualize communication patterns.
- **Igraph**: For network analysis and visualization.
- **Gephi**: To create dynamic visualizations of the email network.

## Conclusion
This project offers a deep dive into the communication dynamics at Enron, shedding light on how relationships and influence played a role in the company’s internal processes. By utilizing social network analysis, this study provides a clearer picture of the hierarchical structures and patterns that may have contributed to the crisis.
