      <data key="e_body">According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.

It is poss=ible they will ask for additional information. =20=20Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6=.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee=p the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b=y the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re=imburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron s ultimate outflow will= be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern=ative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol=itical implications.=20Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt=ra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor=th noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi=ll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can t get bid bonds on its o=wn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM s mar=ginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m=apped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit &quot;one-sided&quot; in favor of the distri=butor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the =distco to change terms without success. =20=20Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can t work with us.  Operationall=y, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI s fuel su=pplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We =are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.=20Ecoelectrica:This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process: = Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst=and that Mirant s insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le=nders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio=n coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lend=ers appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% o=f the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional= $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic=k back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi=th QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week a=nd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender= s agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le=nder group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to prov=iding comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have =reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to s=ending their &quot;versions&quot; of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday ni=te (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th=at the documents are &quot;conforming&quot;.  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to final=ize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfillin=g CP s as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we= can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can c=lose CP s by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed l=ight on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi=gate further. =20=20APACHI =20=20Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg=otiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas=t enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday s New York event.  Nevert=heless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen=t date; funding wouldn t occur until early next year.=20=20Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting the=m over the hump on the issue of Enron s contingent obligation to cover the =potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings h=ave been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. ==20=20China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely c=auses still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Wor=k on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with =Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approa=ched us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits= to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayme=nt ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation. =20=20Europe =20=20Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to pr=ovide limited technical support and financial services support to help put =in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction act=ivities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligatio=ns.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE s $9 million of guar=antees. =20=20Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good= meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government =stated they would &quot;clean up&quot; arrears but could not do so before January 200=2 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to wor=k with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the =legal opinion they had sought and received didn t address the issue properl=y and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backin=g it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Governme=nt &quot;terms of reference&quot; on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of= change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they woul=d expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed pos=ition against it. =20=20Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor s c=laim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on No=vember 30th.

      <data key="e_subject">EOTT Issue</data>
      <data key="e_body">On tuesday of this week after EOTT s staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big).    I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.   This means coming up with an answer very quickly.   There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.   Seems like an expense item, but doable.2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.    Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue.   Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee.   Potentially the captive could be used.3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up.   i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API s.     Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward.    If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will.   I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee.  I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them.    If you have questions, feel free to ask.    Stan is aware of what we are discussing.   1) and 3) were his requests to review.Rod HayslettEB4054713-853-6178</data>

      <data key="e_body">FYI-----Original Message-----From: Stevens, Kirk Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 2:45 PMTo: Butts, Bob; Hayslett, RodCc: Piro, JimSubject: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential Quick update on our Q3 earnings (still very prelim).3rd Current Estimate:       IBIT = (2.7)       NI    = (1.3)Latest Forecast:       IBIT = (9.1)       NI   = 1.7Major variance - TOLI loss for the month is expected to be $9.5m, or $6.5mworse than our 3rd Current Estimate.  The recent sharp decline in the stockmarket is the driver (post Sept 11 market impact).Without the additional TOLI loss, we d be right on our 3rd Current Estimate.Major Risks - AA&amp;Co. IssuesThe following issues are currently being reviewed and challenged (to differentdegrees) by AA&amp;Co Portland (note- Houston AA&amp;Co - Duncan -has been updated onthese items by Tim McCann - AA&amp;Co Portland).  Our forecast numbers aboveassume positive outcome on all these issues.  We will continue to hold ourground, feeling our positions are appropriate.  But since several of thesehave no direct impact on PGE stand-alone reporting, Houston (you) have betterleverage getting these through the AA&amp;Co staff in Houston that may questionour treatment.TOLI Deferred Tax Reserve - $9mPGE proposes to reverse this reserve established Q4 1999 (at the date of theSierra Sale announcement) since the deal with Sierra was terminated, and sincewe now feel recording this type of reserve is more appropriate at the time ofan actual transfer of the TOLI assets to Enron under any future sale of PGE. AA&amp;Co is fighting this one hard, Greek Rice has been made aware of this.Pension Credit Capitalization - $5m (YTD 9/30 true-up)PGE proposes that we no longer capitalize our FAS 87 pension credit since ourrates assume zero pension costs for ratemaking purposes.  AA&amp;Co. is using aFAS 87 implementation issue to say we still need to capitalize the credit, andpossibly set up a FAS 71 reg asset (although they re still somewhat pushing nochange to our current accounting, ie just keep capitalizing the pensioncredit).Merger MOU Obligation - PVC - $5.7mSince our new ratecase allows recovery of the remaining costs for thiscommittment made as part of the Enron purchase of PGE, we believe theremaining liability set up in purchase accounting on PVC s books can bereversed.  AA&amp;Co. feels we still have an obligation to perform the MOUcommittments (which we do), but we feel that our original estimate of thiscost at the time of the PGE/Enron merger has now been reduced as a result ofthe ratemaking treatment, so it should be reduced to zero.  AA&amp;Co. prefersthat we bring the liability down over time as we fullfill the committment,letting earnings effect come in over time.Severance Reserves - PGH1 ($2.7m) and PVC ($3.5m)At the time of the Enron purchase of PGE, severance reserves were set up foran anticipate number of involuntary terminations expected to occur within thefirst few years of the merger.  Over time, actual severance payments made toPGH or PGE employees have been reversed out of these reserves.  At this point,no future terminations are contemplated which relate to the initial mergerconditions/environment.  Accordingly we plan to reverse these balances toincome Q3.  At this point, AA&amp;Co. thinks we should consider taking these back againstgoodwill (which we feel goes against Purchase Accounting guidance).  Litigation Reserve - PGH1 ($2.1m)PGC and it s subsidiaries had numerous legal issues outstanding at the mergerdate (eg. Columbia Steel, Trojan Recovery, City of Burbank Contract,Bonneville Pacific).   A reserve of $5 million was established in purchaseaccounting for any legal/litigation and settlement costs incurred by PGC andsubsidiaries to defend itself in these types of claims/proceedings.  Thereserve also was to cover any litigation filed post merger directly related tothe merger.Since the merger date, we have reversed actual costs incurred for these typesof activities in the amount of $2.9 million, leaving a remaining reservebalance at 9/30/01 of $2.1 million.At this time, all legal claims outstanding at the merger date have beensettled satisfactorily where no material contingency exists.    Accordingly,we will reverse the remaining balance in Q3 2001.Again, AA&amp;Co has indicated that we had over estimated the original cost ofthese activities in purchase accounting, and that we should now reverse thedifference back through goodwill (again, we think this is a misapplication ofpurchase accounting since we are well outside the orginal 1-2 year window foradjusting goodwill).There are a few other items we re debating with AA&amp;Co (in the range of $4m to6m), and I ll let you know if any of these start to look at risk.   Let me know if you have any questions on these items (503) 464-7121.</data>

Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours. The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.</data>

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

Interesting stuff on the long term power contracts-----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Mon 10/8/2001 12:13 PM To: Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Richter, Jeff; Parquet, David; Steffes, James D.; Kean, Steven J.; Shapiro, Richard; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A. (PR); Mara, Susan; Kaufman, Paul; Robertson, Linda; Landwehr, Susan M.; Badeer, Robert; Etringer, Michael Cc: Subject: FW: DWR ContractsFYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation. Best, Jeff Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state s power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&amp;E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state s electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state s economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. &quot;We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,&quot; said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. &quot;We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal.&quot; Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers  Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. &quot;The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,&quot; Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. &quot;Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,&quot; Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California s electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. &quot;To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,&quot; said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. &quot;There were other means to manage the emergency.&quot; The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. &quot;First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,&quot; said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are &quot;just and reasonable.&quot; FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. &quot;In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,&quot; said Steve Maviglio, the governor s spokesman. &quot;We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.&quot; Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission s action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. &quot;The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,&quot; said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. &quot;It s pretty tough to say,  Let s renegotiate the lowest price contract,  &quot; Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra s contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. &quot;There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,&quot; White said. &quot;The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. &quot;But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don t we ask?&quot; ***************************************************************** State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it s too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01 SACRAMENTO -- California s new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority s goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency s rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. &quot;We re dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What s up with that? It s absolutely ludicrous,   said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers  Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year s, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. &quot;The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,   said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: &quot;We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.&quot; New contracts would increase  green  power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state s energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called &quot;peaker   plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn t completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state s power portfolio. That assessment won t be done until February. &quot;I hope they have a basis on which they ve determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,   said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state s businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they ve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. &quot;I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,   said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis  closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature s auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. &quot;It s not an investigation,   said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But &quot;it s appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.   Keeley s committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority s actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state s work. &quot;The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,   Freeman said. &quot;Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.  </data>

Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz &lt; &lt;http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=.php&gt;&gt;=20THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: &quot;From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!&quot;For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. &quot;The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,&quot;= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, &quot;was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.&quot;The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD &quot;a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it.&quot; At Enron, in fact, you either &quot;got it&quot; or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, &quot;someone cou=ld actually get killed.&quot; Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. &quot;I had no idea what I d let go of,&quot; Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. &quot;Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!&quot; he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. &quot;I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling.&quot; Travel: &quot;You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!&quot; Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. &quot;I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,&quot; he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. &quot;It would have been easy to stay,&quot; he says. &quot;But that wou=ld not have been good for me.&quot;He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation &quot;bizarre&quot; and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. &quot;I m surprised,&quot; he says, &quot;that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.&quot;PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled &quot;the purchase&quot; was being call=ed &quot;the merger&quot; back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. &quot;Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,&quot; says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. &quot;He never fought change. He embraced change.&quot;Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) &quot;I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,&quot; he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call &quot;intellectual capital.&quot; He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them &quot;absolutely compelling.&quot; The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. &quot;Almost to a person,&quot; Skilling says=, &quot;they thought it was stupid.&quot; Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, &quot;Let s go.&quot;The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: &quot;I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough&quot; is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, &quot;We were in=.&quot; And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, &quot;we never looked back.&quot;Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a &quot;knowledge-based business,&quot; which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. &quot;Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,&quot; one former executive explains. &quot;The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.&quot;Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be &quot;a=ggressive.&quot; You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on &quot;Super Saturdays&quot; at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called &quot;a sense =of urgency.&quot; People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. &quot;They were so cutting edge,&quot; rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. &quot;They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.&quot;Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. &quot;If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,&quot; says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. &quot;Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,&quot; one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was &quot;aggressive,&quot; that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. &quot;Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,&quot; the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.&quot;FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,&quot;= sang the New York Times in 1999. &quot;In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,&quot; crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. &quot;Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,&quot; BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them &quot;counterparties.&quot;Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as &quot;mark-to-marke=t accounting,&quot; for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called &quot;subjective accounting,&quot; inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. &quot;Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,&quot; =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: &quot;Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,&quot; he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, &quot;It became a company full of mercenaries.&quot; The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like &quot;I need a smart person-go buy me one&quot; or &quot;Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.&quot; Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became &quot;rank and yank.&quot;) It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, &quot;Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store.&quot; Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =&quot;They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,&quot; says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase &quot;No old tapes&quot; became a=n Enron clich?. &quot;People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,&quot; says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: &quot;They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.&quot;BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. &quot;It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,&quot; an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= &quot;It was the technology era.&quot;To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. &quot;I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,&quot; Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, &quot;They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.&quot;=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: &quot;The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,&quot; he told the press. &quot;Enron is doing extremely= well now.&quot; In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. &quot;For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,&quot; says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. &quot;We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.&quot; (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (&quot;At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.&quot;)But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an &quot;asshole.&quot; When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. &quot;Th=ere wasn t any positive news,&quot; Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. &quot;Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.&quot;The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (&quot;Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?&quot;) The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. &quot;When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,=&quot; says Carol Coale. &quot;When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.&quot;This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. &quot;It just created an attitude,&quot; one executive still at Enron says.= &quot;If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. &quot;=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. &quot;But,&quot; as= one Houston oilman explains, &quot;if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.&quot;As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but &quot;innovat=e much closer to our core.&quot; As for the culture: &quot;Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.&quot;That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. &quot;Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,&quot; one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. &quot;Look,&quot; he s=ays with finality, &quot;ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.&quot;Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. &quot;The first wave never gets it right,&quot; he says. &quot;The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world.&quot; Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space.&quot;This is the second wave, and Enron s got it,&quot; he says, almost breathless. =&quot;There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it.&quot;</data>

This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don t already have them in place.Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.

I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron s corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.Regards,Kevin</data>

      <data key="e_body">FYI-----Original Message-----From: Brownfeld, Gail Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 10:01 AMTo: Sanders, Richard B.Subject: FW: York Paper v. Enron/HolzerFYI-----Original Message----- From: Clothier, Robert Sent: Thu 10/11/2001 10:51 AM To: Brownfeld, Gail Cc: Klein, Samuel; Dubas, Jennifer Subject: York Paper v. Enron/HolzerPrivileged and ConfidentialGail,I had a productive conversation with Keith Dutill, the Stradley lawyer whoI ve known for decades and who is now representing York Paper.The short of it is that he said he is very interested in trying to resolvethis before the litigation machinery cranks up.  He will discuss it with hisclient and get back to me.  He said that York has &quot;strong feelings&quot; and thenagreed with me that Enron feels the same way.  He felt that York has a &quot;goodbusiness sense&quot; and would be interested in reaching a compromise withoutspending a lot of dollars in legal fees.Dutill does not know why two separate summons were filed in Delaware County.It s his understanding that the claims against Enron are largely the same asthe claims against Holzer (with perhaps one or two exceptions that stillrelate to Holzer s employment with Enron).  He is working on a complaintthat will cover both summons, and expects to file it in the next severalweeks, certainly before the mediation conference on November 19th.  I saidthat we should try to start our own discussions before that mediationconference so that the mediator could focus on any areas of disagreement.Here s how Dutill described York s claims:  Holzer worked for York Paper.When Holzer left York, York wanted to prevent Holzer from working for Enron.Holzer wanted to work for Enron, and so did Enron, so there was some&quot;agreement&quot; between Holzer/Enron and York.  In that &quot;agreement&quot;, Holzer andEnron made &quot;promises&quot; about the way they &quot;would do business&quot; with York.  Itappears that the promise was that Holzer and Enron would not bypass YorkPaper and deal directly with York Paper s customers.  Yet, according toDutill, that is what Holzer and Enron did -- cut out York Paper as themiddle man.  This has resulted in a &quot;fair erosion of business&quot; for YorkPaper.  It is &quot;not just a matter of subsequent solicitation.&quot;  It alsoinvolves &quot;interference with existing contracts&quot; between York and itscustomers. So, it would seem that York s claims might include breach of contract,interference with contractual relations and, perhaps,misrepresentation/fraud.  Interestingly, he did not mention any of the WestCoast and Garden State Paper contracts we have been looking into.If you have any thoughts, please let me know.  I will keep you informed ofany further developments.BobDechert215-994-2714215-994-2222 (fax)robert.clothier@dechert.com&gt; The information contained in this e-mail message and any attachment(s)&gt; hereto is legally privileged and confidential information intended only&gt; for the use of the individual or entity named above.

I m hopeful, after reading the following, that you will feel it  is worthwhile for us to get together again. First, my last litigation project at  Fulbright &amp; Jaworski just came to a close very unexpectedly, due  to a third party stay order, and I am once again looking for new matters to work  on.  I have attached my updated resume for your reference, or to pass on to  others in your Law Department who might have needs for my type of skills on a  project basis.  At a current billing rate of $80 per hour, engaging me  (with a specialization in this field for over 11 years)  for basic document  production activity generally will produce a meaningful cost savings  vs. utilization of even the most junior, inexperienced associate in an  outside counsel firm for such tasks.  I think I ve mentioned to you before  that I have particular expertise in dealing with productions of electronic  documents -- especially email in a variety of application formats. Second --and more importantly -- I  have reflected several years about what my ideal job would be, if  I were to go to work again on a permanent basis.  This week, I finally  took time to draft out a general job description of that job.  I have  called it, for now, a &quot;Legal Information Counsel&quot; position within a corporate  law department.  My draft job description is also attached.    I believe a strong case can be made  to justify such a position in many large, diverse corporations with multiple  lines of business.  In a nutshell, that justification is twofold:  (1)  avoidance of repeated re-inventions of the wheel across an organization, as it  relates to the expensive process of handling documents and data generated  by complex litigation and other corporate legal matters;  and (2) taking a  proactive leadership approach to legally significant information in a  corporation, vs. constantly being in a reactive mode as new fires break  out.   I urge you to review both my resume,  and the Legal Information Counsel description attached, and then let me come in  to visit with you about them.  I am particularly interested in your  reaction and comments to the Legal Information Counsel concept, over and above  whether such a position might be an appropriate addition to the Enron Corporate  Law Department.   I appreciate your time, Jim, and  look forward to having the opportunity to visit with you again.

Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 13 percent, to $7.89 in late morning trading. Enron s 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said. Enron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive. ``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,   said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold  and doesn t own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.   Dynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy s offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show. ``It s become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren t 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,   said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There s just so much information that is unknowable   about Enron s financial position, he said. SEC Filing Last week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core   businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions   from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific. Enron wouldn t comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. Most of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares. ``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,   Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.   Enron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period s loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million. A drop in Enron s senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-   by Standard &amp; Poor s on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn t find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing. Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership s assets, Enron said. The company said it s working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. Fourth Quarter Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron s fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron s stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said. ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. Shares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston. Enron s Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year.</data>

My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.   -----Original Message-----From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRONSent:	Friday, November 30, 2001 5:58 PMTo:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRONSubject:	UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next WeekMany of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.Ken</data>

Enron s Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay AwayBy Herb Greenberg &lt;&lt;mailto:hgreenberg@thestreet.com&gt;&gt;Senior ColumnistRealMoney.com10/24/2001 03:40 PM EDTURL: &lt;&lt;http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/10002953.html&gt;&gt;Updated from 2:47 p.m. EDT If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they re looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can t service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, &quot;accounting irregularities = sell.&quot; Good point. Now let s back that up with the bond market s view, which can be seen in the so-called &quot;swap spread,&quot; which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It s a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron s five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it s 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That s a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that s still not enough &quot;where the accounting is questionable,&quot; one bond trader says. &quot;You re not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value.&quot; Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They re nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they re not jumping to buy Enron s bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to &quot;hope-springs-eternal&quot; stock investors!) Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn t find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody ll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence. Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on EnronBy James J. Cramer &lt;&lt;mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com&gt;&gt;RealMoney.com10/24/2001 10:33 AM EDTURL: &lt;&lt;http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002911.html&gt;&gt;Accounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn t sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can t see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. But I bet I still won t like it. Enron s Excuses Sound FamiliarBy James J. Cramer &lt;&lt;mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com&gt;&gt;RealMoney.com10/23/2001 01:43 PM EDTURL: &lt;&lt;http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002874.html&gt;&gt;If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? That s what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go --  80s! In the  80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. Nope. What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. Enron didn t use taxpayers  money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn t leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. We don t want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn t about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. In the meantime, I wouldn t touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one s gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does. FOOL ON THE HILL Enron s Disdain for Investors The Motley Fool.com10/24/01While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO s past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter s conference call and press release, something we don t like but is prevalent, it also doesn t release its balance sheet. The company must think we re idiots. They re wrong. By Tom Jacobs &lt;&lt;http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm&gt;&gt; (TMF Tom9) October 24, 2001 Enron s (NYSE: ENE) &lt;&lt;http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE&gt;&gt; troubles just don t stop. On Monday, the company announced &lt;&lt;http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html&gt;&gt; that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on &quot;certain related party transactions &lt;&lt;http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm&gt;&gt;.&quot; That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:The company s board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- &quot;incentivize&quot; the CFO, and it was not legal; It was legal, but unethical; or Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times  Floyd Norris calls them &quot;some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen.&quot; That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company s SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare s King Lear -- &quot;that way madness lies.&quot; On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the &quot;Certain Transactions&quot; section of the company s latest proxy statement &lt;&lt;http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&amp;currTicker=ene&amp;symbols=ene&amp;guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D&gt;&gt;.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.What s worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.The quarterly call and press release paradeMost companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter s numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure &lt;&lt;http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm&gt;&gt; -- &quot;Reg. FD&quot; -- analysts don t get a secret call with the &quot;real&quot; numbers at another time than the public. We like that.Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers &lt;&lt;http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm&gt;&gt; and EBITDA &lt;&lt;http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm&gt;&gt; -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of &quot;bullfeathers!&quot; It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: &quot;Earnings up!&quot; (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: &quot;Revenues up!&quot; (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness &lt;&lt;http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm&gt;&gt;.At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why? Hiding the cash flow statementBecause almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite.You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company s business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments &lt;&lt;http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm&gt;&gt;. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time. Check the companies you own. If they don t release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren t ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn t we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow? If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron s only sin, it wouldn t be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween &lt; &lt;http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm&gt;&gt; scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better.Hiding the balance sheetFor at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That s right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet?The only conclusion can be that management doesn t want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won t bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly &quot;called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners.&quot;Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company s attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling s gone, but the practice hasn t changed. It s about managementWe don t depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company s financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes &amp; Data page &lt;&lt;http://quote.fool.com/&gt;&gt;. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don t read their filings carefully. It s hard enough to discern what s going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.What Enron s failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it ll be darned if it ll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management s spin. In Enron s case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron s earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes &lt;&lt;http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151&gt;&gt;:&quot;On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company s previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn t normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won t have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.&quot;That s a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today s income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what s the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Barr10/24/2001Capital Markets Report(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, &quot;started trading with a dollar price two days ago,&quot; said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80 s to low 90 s, say traders. Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. &quot;Credit bonds,&quot; which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. Moody s Investors Service rates the company s senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard &amp; Poor s Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. But the company &quot;may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, &quot; said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin &amp; Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. &quot;I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,&quot; Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can t have paper below investment-grade. Houston-based Enron, the nation s biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. The company s stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is &quot;not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don t know.&quot; -By Michael C. Barr, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2008; michael.barr@dowjones.com (David Feldheim contributed to this article.)Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.By Kevin Drawbaugh10/24/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group s cofounder said on Wednesday. In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.&quot;It s always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,&quot; said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. &quot;There s been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,&quot; said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America s large pension funds. The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company s chief financial officer, Minow said. &quot;Where was the Enron board in all of this?&quot; she asked. &quot;Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn t happen here.&quot; Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. &quot;This isn t just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,&quot; she said. Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. &quot;Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,&quot; said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. &quot;More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,&quot; Gleason said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

      <data key="e_body">Here is the other article=20How Enron Blew ItLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz &lt;/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php&gt;THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: &quot;From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!&quot;For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. &quot;The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,&quot;= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, &quot;was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.&quot;The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD &quot;a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it.&quot; At Enron, in fact, you either &quot;got it&quot; or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, &quot;someone cou=ld actually get killed.&quot; Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. &quot;I had no idea what I d let go of,&quot; Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. &quot;Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!&quot; he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. &quot;I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling.&quot; Travel: &quot;You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!&quot; Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. &quot;I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,&quot; he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. &quot;It would have been easy to stay,&quot; he says. &quot;But that wou=ld not have been good for me.&quot;=20He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation &quot;bizarre&quot; and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. &quot;I m surprised,&quot; he says, &quot;that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.&quot;PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled &quot;the purchase&quot; was being call=ed &quot;the merger&quot; back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. &quot;Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,&quot; says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. &quot;He never fought change. He embraced change.&quot;Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.=20LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) &quot;I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,&quot; he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call &quot;intellectual capital.&quot; He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them &quot;absolutely compelling.&quot; The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. &quot;Almost to a person,&quot; Skilling says=, &quot;they thought it was stupid.&quot; Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, &quot;Let s go.&quot;The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: &quot;I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough&quot; is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, &quot;We were in=.&quot; And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, &quot;we never looked back.&quot;Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a &quot;knowledge-based business,&quot; which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. &quot;Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,&quot; one former executive explains. &quot;The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.&quot;Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be &quot;a=ggressive.&quot; You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on &quot;Super Saturdays&quot; at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called &quot;a sense =of urgency.&quot; People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. &quot;They were so cutting edge,&quot; rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. &quot;They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.&quot;Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. &quot;If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,&quot; says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. &quot;Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,&quot; one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was &quot;aggressive,&quot; that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. &quot;Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,&quot; the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.&quot;FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,&quot;= sang the New York Times in 1999. &quot;In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,&quot; crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. &quot;Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,&quot; BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them &quot;counterparties.&quot;Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as &quot;mark-to-marke=t accounting,&quot; for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called &quot;subjective accounting,&quot; inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. &quot;Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,&quot; =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: &quot;Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,&quot; he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, &quot;It became a company full of mercenaries.&quot; The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like &quot;I need a smart person-go buy me one&quot; or &quot;Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.&quot; Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became &quot;rank and yank.&quot;) It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, &quot;Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store.&quot; Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =&quot;They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,&quot; says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase &quot;No old tapes&quot; became a=n Enron clich?. &quot;People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,&quot; says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: &quot;They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.&quot;BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. &quot;It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,&quot; an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= &quot;It was the technology era.&quot;To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. &quot;I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,&quot; Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, &quot;They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.&quot;=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: &quot;The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,&quot; he told the press. &quot;Enron is doing extremely= well now.&quot; In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. &quot;For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,&quot; says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. &quot;We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.&quot; (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (&quot;At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.&quot;)But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an &quot;asshole.&quot; When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. &quot;Th=ere wasn t any positive news,&quot; Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. &quot;Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.&quot;The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (&quot;Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?&quot;) The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. &quot;When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,=&quot; says Carol Coale. &quot;When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.&quot;This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. &quot;It just created an attitude,&quot; one executive still at Enron says.= &quot;If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. &quot;=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. &quot;But,&quot; as= one Houston oilman explains, &quot;if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.&quot;As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but &quot;innovat=e much closer to our core.&quot; As for the culture: &quot;Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.&quot;That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. &quot;Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,&quot; one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. &quot;Look,&quot; he s=ays with finality, &quot;ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.&quot;Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. &quot;The first wave never gets it right,&quot; he says. &quot;The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world.&quot; Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space.&quot;This is the second wave, and Enron s got it,&quot; he says, almost breathless. =&quot;There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it.&quot;</data>

This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTDThe West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW s business is the West market.  The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be combined.Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct marketsThanks!

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, &quot;We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent s Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.&quot; Regent President John Ehrman said, &quot;The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.&quot; The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent s core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.</data>

      <data key="e_body">According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.

      <data key="e_body">John,Let me begin by recognizing that you are now entrusted to resolve issues that were not of your own creation.  I also appreciate the tremendous amount of stress that you have been under especially considering the birth of your second child.  I do not envy you now, yet I am sincerely grateful that it is you and Greg leading us through these times.The message that you have sent throughout my six years with Enron has been &quot;trust the system until it fails you&quot;.  We would all be disappointed if our troubled times were a result of a few (rather large) ill-conceived investments, but the violation of trust comes from the deliberate misrepresentation of facts.  Namely the restatement of earnings and balance sheet items back to 1997.  We have all based our decisions to continue employment with Enron upon publicly available information.  Has fraudulence been proven in a court of law?  No.  However, the court of public opinion has already had it its trial, the perpetrators have been convicted and the victims now await retribution.  In this matter, the corporation is responsible to the court of public opinions jurisdiction.  I write you now to offer my version of justice.From 1997 to date I have received restricted stock and options with a notional value of approximately $700,000 (by memory).  At the end of each compensation period, I based my decision to continue my employment with Enron on all publicly available information.  This corporation has deliberately and knowingly misrepresented these facts.  Today, I call on Enron to repurchase my entire equity portfolio and replace it with a one time lump sum payment equal to the exact notional value.My situation is certainly unique.  I can save you the effort and inform you that my net career to date contribution is $zero.  To this I have three responses: (1)  At no time did I falter from the highest ethical standard, whereas Enron has; (2) I am calling for Enron to address its misrepresentations made prior to my 2001 misfortune.  It would be an injustice for Enron to use my 2001 performance to justify its prior unethical compensation program; and (3) I am fully prepared to accept zero performance bonus for this year. Enron may not be able to offer this solution to all of its employees.  You may need to make decisions on who to keep.  Perhaps Enron should offer to release those less desired individuals from any contractual obligations.John, I recognize that these issues cannot be resolved over night.  I will be as patient as I can be.Sincerely,Keith</data>

Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERCDynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year.2.	MISO vs. ARTOIP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won t state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year in Illinois.3.	CTC Bet in ComEdMy recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn t happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.4.	Delivery Service Tariff LitigationComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) TerminationComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to &quot;deliver&quot; today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?6.	Relative Size of Current EES BookComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.Jim</data>

      <data key="e_body">Thanks, Lamar.  The ARM coalition s attorney is drafting the comments, which should be ready for review later this morning.  The comments will deal exclusively with the rules governing the DA suspension and won t address the contracts issue--comments on Carl Wood s demand to see the contracts will come later in the week, or first thing next week. With respect to the positions in the comments, it s a composite of the positions of many ESPs and their customers.  Appears that some ESPs in the ARM group may want to assign customers to another ESP, which is why those comments are there.  Also, some customers want to be classified as DA in perpetuity, irrespective of their contract terms--which is why renewal, or the ability to change to another ESP, will get a lot of play.  And as you know, UC is being very aggressive in our planning meetings about facility-adds. We could file separately, but the combined push for 1) establishing liberal suspension rules and 2) keeping contracts out of the Commission s hands will come from other folks and is likely to be pretty strong.  Not sure that separate comments would get us any additional value.  Let us know what you think. In addition, Carl Wood isn t very interested in balancing suspension rules with the need to review contracts.  He s taking a &quot;chain saw&quot; approach.  He claims that he wants to see the contracts in order to determine whether he can re-set the suspension date retroactive to July 1, which the rest of the Commission currently does not seem to support.  In short, he appears hell-bent on trying to get his hands on people s contracts.  At this point the industry seems pretty solidly united in its opposition to giving them to him.   We re contacting the other Commissioners to determine whether Wood is out on his own on the contract issue--our sense at this point is that he may not have any support from other commissioners.  We ll let you know as soon as we find out. I ll forward the draft ARM comments to you and Kevin later this AM.  If you have any other quesitons, let us know. On the cost allocation issues, that s on a slightly slower track, but in the same forum.  Edison s position is the one they proposed to us in negotiations, which we rejected--1) all customers pay for Edison s undercollection (bundled and DA alike), 2) all customers pay for stranded DWR long-term contracts (bundled and DA alike).   The advice letters regarding implementation of the DA suspension don t offer any real detail on allocation and those issues will be hard-fought over during the first part of Q1.

This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

Any further downgrade into non-investment grade&gt; levels could seriously affect relationships between counterparties and&gt; Enron, and possibly Enron counterparties and their counterparties.&gt;&gt;       Enron is the principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and&gt; natural gas trades in the United States.  For Enron s power and gas&gt; trading counterparties, a credit event such as a downgrade by Moody s may&gt; precipitate certain obligations under the terms of their trading&gt; transactions.  For example, any downgrade, not just a downgrade resulting&gt; in a sub-investment grade rating, may entitle a counterparty to require&gt; Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enron s purchase&gt; obligations.  Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other&gt; commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess&gt; this right.  The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver&gt; and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance,&gt; threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations&gt; upon which the transactions were originally based.  Furthermore, a failure&gt; to declare a credit event or default against Enron could cause a default&gt; on the part of the counterparty itself in collateral or ancillary&gt; arrangements, such as its financing.  The potential for a domino effect,&gt; causing defaults or credit events in a series of transactions, is&gt; considerable.&gt;&gt;       It is uncertain whether Enron s efforts to obtain new lines of&gt; credit will be sufficient to overcome the current difficulties.&gt; Regardless, it is prudent to review the terms of existing transactions&gt; with Enron or its affiliates, including any guarantees or other forms of&gt; corporate credit support.  It is also advisable to examine the terms of&gt; transactions dependent on, or otherwise ancillary to, transactions with&gt; Enron or its affiliates to avoid any consequential effects of the Enron&gt; credit ratings downgrade.&gt;&gt;       For further information on how Enron s current financial situation&gt; could impact your firm s transaction risk profile, please contact Michael&gt; Zimmer at 202.452.7055 or michael.j.zimmer@bakernet.com, Jonathan W.&gt; Gottlieb at 202.452.7084 or jonathan.w.gottlieb@bakernet.com or Samir&gt; Desai at 202.452.7057 or samir.s.desai@bakernet.com .&gt;&gt; Michael J.

The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.Enron s Credit Rating of BBB(S&amp;P), and Baa2(Moody s)General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.Registration Under SubPart B:EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB- (Duff 	&amp; Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES  revenue for last fiscal year; or		3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES s revenue for the last fiscal year; or	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES  contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or		5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an &quot;A&quot; rated financial 	insitution; or		6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.Enron s Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&amp;P) and Baa2 (Moody s), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES s ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.Single Bill Option:Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an &quot;A&quot; rating	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB-(duff &amp;Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)		4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.Enron s Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp s current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month s estimated IFC charges for all EES  customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES  customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP s service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.</data>

Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.Registration Under SubPart B:EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB- (Duff 	&amp; Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES  revenue for last fiscal year; or		3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES s revenue for the last fiscal year; or	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES  contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or		5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an &quot;A&quot; rated financial 	insitution; or		6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.Enron s Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&amp;P) and Baa2 (Moody s), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES s ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.Single Bill Option:Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an &quot;A&quot; rating	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB-(duff &amp;Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)		4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.Enron s Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp s current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month s estimated IFC charges for all EES  customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES  customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP s service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.</data>

If we intervened it might be possible to do so without paying any of the costs, assuming Blackhawk and AES/New Energy agree (we have done this for them in the past).Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.  Downsides are that this really gets into rate issues that in previous RCR discussions we were told to stay away from and secondly, do we really want to be supporting an audit and investigation of another utility s books and records right now, given Enron s position?

It hasn t. MATTHEW C. QUINN STAFF Nov. 4, 2001 Atlanta Journal/Atlanta Constitution Home Page E.1 (Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001) Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there s widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. Instead, here s what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter s record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.&quot;No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they ve had to go through,&quot; said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably &quot;swimming against the tide.&quot;Georgia s relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.&quot;There s plenty of blame to go around here,&quot; she said, noting that &quot;never in the history of Georgia&quot; has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has &quot;profound concerns&quot; about the impact on consumers.Barnes said he s not out to scrap deregulation. That s a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.Many of them haven t paid since last winter s frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, &quot;it was a lot easier&quot; to straighten out problems, Coveny said. &quot;We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships.&quot;High pricesJessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state s top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that &quot;the computer messed up.&quot; She s been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion s service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she &quot;yelled and screamed&quot; and complained to the PSC. &quot;I have to have gas,&quot; she said. &quot;I have seven children.&quot; Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.&quot;If people don t pay us in 45 days, they get a notice,&quot; Benfield said. &quot;In most cases they pay.&quot;The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.&quot;People aren t being treated right,&quot; says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. It s not clear &quot;how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation,&quot; said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.Reeling from bad debtResidential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light s distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL s charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what s authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it s entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it s hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia s gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn t pay their bills. While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they d recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. &quot;California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power,&quot; said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.When Georgia s moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.&quot;You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality,&quot; Darby said.Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia s No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is &quot;circling the wagons.&quot;Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia &quot;has not been an exciting profit picture for us,&quot; but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: &quot;Unless things get better, no company can survive this.&quot;Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state s top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. &quot;It s not been a good business for us,&quot; said Rosput of AGL.No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it s in for the long term.New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia s natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn t like the idea. The company s stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it s not planning to pull out.Still, there s concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.PSC member Baker already sees an &quot;oligopoly&quot; with limited competition. Consumer choice &quot;is supposed to be the hallmark&quot; of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, &quot;consumers have less and less.&quot; Re-regulation  callsSo far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. Calls for &quot;re-regulation&quot; are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.&quot;We can t let Georgia consumers suffer for another year,&quot; said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the  97 law, said he s concerned about gas prices, but he s not sure re-regulation is &quot;doable at this point.&quot;Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. &quot;We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have,&quot; saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: &quot;If it s re-regulated, who takes the ball?&quot; says PSC Chairman Lauren &quot;Bubba&quot; McDonald Jr.Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.Then there s the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a &quot;bailout&quot; to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for &quot;fixing&quot; deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.Rosput said she s &quot;prepared to get to a solution,&quot; but like everyone else, she doesn t have an answer.&quot;It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship,&quot; she said, &quot;and there s no safe shore or good place to land.&quot; 713-853-9287 888-703-0309</data>

Stewart.  &quot;Manufacturing employment is down 63,000 this year and by more than 10,000 jobs in September alone. The state s unemployment rate has risen steadily for the eight consecutive months, peaking at its present 5.4 percent.&quot; &quot;It s time for the state to implement new policies that will incent investment sooner rather than later,&quot; said Stewart. CMTA today will introduce proposals to: Implement a Sales Tax Exemption &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201&gt; ( &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/salestax110201&gt;) on Manufacturing, Processing and Telecommunications Equipment Reduce Electricity Rates &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201&gt; ( &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/electricrates110201&gt;) and Provide Customer Choice in Energy Declare a Moratorium on New and Increased Regulatory Fees &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201&gt; ( &lt;http://www.cmta.net/press/stopfees110201&gt;) and Taxes These initiatives will comprise the association s focus in the coming months, and were a collaborative effort among CMTA members. &quot;The costs associated with a battered business community are not only measured by stock-tickers and cable financial networks.  They are the human toll of jobs that are lost, mortgages that fail and families that go with less,&quot; added Stewart.  &quot;These measures will restore confidence in every manufacturers  ability to remain productive and allow them to reinvest in the state s workforce.&quot; California s manufacturing sector currently produces: 80 percent of state exports One sixth of state payroll 40 percent higher wages than the statewide average And for every manufacturing job, an additional 1-3 jobs are produced &quot;These proposals are common sense ideas that will send a strong message to the largest and most important sector of our economy that the state will provide the critical relief they need to help themselves and help California through this economic crisis,&quot; concluded Stewart.   BAY AREA VENTURE INVESTMENT FALLS According to just released data from Venture Economics and  the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), venture capital investment in the Bay Area during the 3rd quarter dropped 27 percent over the 2nd quarter of this year. Investment has slowed significantly this year and the 3rd quarter investment is 74 percent lower than the $9.3 billion high reached during the 2nd quarter of 2000. The Bay Area drop in investment nearly matched the national trend for the 3rd quarter. Venture capitalists invested $7.7 billion nationally during the quarter, down 31 percent from the previous quarter, and 73 percent from the $28.5 billion high of last year. &quot;Although these are clearly difficult times for all business sectors, the venture industry will persevere. Veterans in our industry recognize this downturn as part of the long-term venture capital cycle. Real value can be created in down cycles by sticking with committed entrepreneurs with strong business models and the tenacity to see their ideas through,&quot; commented Mark Heesen, NVCA President.   CMTA GETS VETO ON BILL RESTRICTING SICK LEAVE At the urging of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association (CMTA) and other employer organizations, Governor Gray Davis vetoed SB 1197 by Senator Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles). The bill would have prohibited an employer to count any sick leave taken by an employee to tend to a sick child, parent or spouse in any absence control program Current law permits an employee to use half of their annual accrued sick leave in a calendar year to attend to the illness of a child, parent, or spouse who would not otherwise qualify under the family medical leave act that only applies to serious health conditions.  The provision covers brief illnesses such as colds, high temperature, sore throats etc., that are more likely to be associated with children and is less likely to involve physician or hospital care.  However, employers opposed the bill because many employees take advantage of the easy threshold and use it to avoid workplace sanctions. When employees don t show up or show up late for work, it negatively impacts production.  In order to mitigate this problem, employers have implemented absentee control programs that may include counseling, suspension and termination.  After the above provision became law, employers began to see a steady rise in the use and abuse of sick leave under this provision, so employers decided to include sick leave in their employee absence control programs in order to eliminate the abuse.  SB 1197 would have eliminated that option and could have forced employers to take a more drastic action to resolve the problem. In addition to insuring that production schedules are met, the main reason for an employer s absence policy is to provide a fair way to identify and deal with those employees who have trouble coming to work as scheduled and/or on time.  Making a decision to sanction an employee under an absence control policy is not taken lightly by employers and must be based on sound reasoning.  For example, if an employee s attendance records were examined and patterns of use involving sick leave were to show unusually high usage on Fridays, Mondays and holiday weekends and the employee were to declare that the absences were for family member sick leave purposes, no disciplinary action could be taken. In other instances, it is used to cover for tardiness that would otherwise be sanctioned under the employer absence control program by calling in just before the shift begins in order to start the shift late. SB 1197 would have provided for new lawsuits for violation of the statute where an employer has an absence control policy.  Consider that employers are not required to provide sick leave and the bill would only apply to those employers who voluntarily provide sick leave for their employees.  CMTA discussed with legislators the counter-productive nature of restricting an employer s ability to manage a voluntarily provided benefit. When laws become overly restrictive or very difficult to comply with and the employer is facing sanctions for violations, it provides a strong incentive for the employer to simply eliminate their sick leave program. CMTA believes that it would be poor public policy to protect those employees who have trouble getting to work under SB 1197 and could end up eliminating the benefit for all employees.  CMTA applauds Governor Davis s veto of the bill.     www.cmta.net &lt;http://www.cmta.net/&gt; California Manufacturers &amp; Technology Association 980 9th Street, Suite 2200 Sacramento, CA  95814 (916) 441-5420 phone (916) 447-9401 fax You are receiving this message today because your company is a valued member of the California Manufacturers &amp; Technology Association (CMTA).

      <data key="e_body">1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERCDynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year.2.	MISO vs. ARTOIP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won t state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year in Illinois.3.	CTC Bet in ComEdMy recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn t happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.4.	Delivery Service Tariff LitigationComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) TerminationComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to &quot;deliver&quot; today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?6.	Relative Size of Current EES BookComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.Jim</data>

      <data key="e_body">I agree with John Shelk to not attack the CBO report.While the CBO again and again relies upon academic studies to state that ge=nerators &quot;may&quot; have withheld power, the basic argument is that &quot;DEREGULATIO=N ITSELF NOT FAIL; RATHER, IT WAS NEVER ACHEIVED.&quot;   In addition, the paper= states that &quot;MUCH OF THE BLAME FOR CALIFORNIA S ELECTRICITY CRISIS ATTACHE=S TO THE STATE S RESTRUCTURING PLAN -- BUT NOT TO ITS OBJECTIVE, ELECTRICIT=Y DEREGULATION.&quot;In addition, California s response of &quot;DIRECTLY INTERVENING IN THE MARKET -=- A RESPONSE THAT COULD PROVE COSTLY TO ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS AND TAXPAYERS=.&quot;I hope that we can use this to persuade FERC that they are missing the boat= on the Refund case.  The CBO has now stated publicly that the fundamental =market conditions and the State s poor plan and actions created the financi=al and political crisis.  The CBO finds that &quot;WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY PRICES =WERE HIGHER THAN THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A TRADITIONALLY REGULATED= MARKET OR A MORE FULLY DEREGULATED MARKET&quot;..because &quot;FEATURES OF THE RESTR=UCTURING PLAN LIMITED THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES OF =THE ELECTRICITY MARKET.&quot;Seems to me that we need to devise a strategy to get this message out (toge=ther with our details of the policy failures).  This CBO report clearly und=ercuts the &quot;political&quot; arguments of the Davis administration who had every =opportunity to fix the plan and who has now not only bought into horrible l=ong-term contracts but has passed through 100% of the high costs to consume=rs.Jim=20 -----Original Message-----From: =09Shelk, John =20Sent:=09Tuesday, October 09, 2001 12:39 PMTo:=09Perrino, DaveCc:=09Robertson, Linda; Steffes, James D.Subject:=09RE: Causes and Lessons of the CA Electricity Crisis - by the CBOSubject to receiving more information, my recommendation is not to make a &quot;=federal case&quot; out of the CBO report.

The report is being written up favorably in the= trade press I have seen, largely because the CBO report says that what Cal=ifornia did was NOT deregulation and thus the crisis was not caused by dere=gulation.

It also paid little attention to the issues that FERC had= addressed and that the ISO did not implement.  It is reasonably sound as f=ar as &quot;history of the formation&quot; is concerned but some of their statements =and conclusions I have to take issue with. =20Off the top of my head, they use the term &quot;idle&quot;.  In my mind as a utility =person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term,= they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced= off or was off for maintenance, I realize it s only a word, but it carries= many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they= refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su=pply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact= as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho=wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric=es, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und=erstood the full picture.  They also don t really touch on the lack of supp=ly side response.

      <data key="e_body">Jeremy --To let you know where we stand on the CPUC s Investigation on DA Suspension.  1.	Sue Mara is leading the effort to respond to the CPUC for Enron.2.

      <data key="e_body">I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our &quot;positive&quot; CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their &quot;goofy&quot; arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that s a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren t talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.Jim -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 6:18 PMTo:	Curry, WandaCc:	Steffes, James D.; Tribolet, MichaelSubject:	RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC PaidNeed to think about it a bit.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here s what he said:They plan to &quot;settle&quot; with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1 02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility s undercollection and that the ESP s share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge s recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison &quot;meet and confer&quot; with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on &quot;getting ESPs paid&quot; and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison s stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn t assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic &quot;perfect storm&quot; and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state s expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. &quot;If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?&quot; asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. &quot;Good luck!&quot; former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor s plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. &quot;This could save billions of dollars,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis  power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis  legal affairs secretary, said the administration is &quot;not targeting every contract&quot; because the pacts have been &quot;extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.&quot; The governor s aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don t require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

There are (at least) 3 things going on here:1) Coordinate PG&amp;E/SCE2) Edison &quot;meet and confer&quot; (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder s coordinating.2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov t affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.

      <data key="e_body">State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau &lt;mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com&gt;Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: &lt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL&gt;Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state s three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. &quot;Circumstances have changed,&quot; said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. &quot;Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market.&quot; Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis  administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn t adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides  numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.</data>

      <data key="e_body">Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won t address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I m not even sure that the Commission can successfully &quot;regulate&quot; prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.   But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it s very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.   That said, I don t want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

      <data key="e_body">Good draft.  Few comments:As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we re going to have to work with them.  As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don t see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to edit, I ve simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally.Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I m repeating Jim s comments here):  e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood s unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl.On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they re in?  Could backfire.Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn t appear we re advocating having folks submit them?Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.

      <data key="e_subject">RE: AReM response to Wood ACR</data>
      <data key="e_body">Good draft.  Few comments:As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we re going to have to work with them.  As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don t see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to edit, I ve simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally.Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I m repeating Jim s comments here):  e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood s unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl.On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they re in?  Could backfire.Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn t appear we re advocating having folks submit them?Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.  Seems that the key thing is to let the Commission know unequivocally that it must hold extensive hearings on the many factual issues in dispute.Best,Jeff  -----Original Message-----From: 	&quot;Mara, Susan&quot; &lt;Susan.J.Mara@ENRON.com&gt;@ENRON  Sent:	Friday, November 02, 2001 10:52 AMTo:	MDay; Dan Douglass; Sue Mara at Enron SF; Jeff Dasovich Enron SFCc:	JBennettSubject:	RE: AReM response to Wood ACRHere s the 2nd draft from yesterday with my comments.

      <data key="e_body">Edison has dripped out information over the last 48 hours that reveals what the team had anticipated for some time:Edison will pay ESPs what they are owed w.r.t. the negative CTC when they pay everyone else (&quot;sometime in Q1 02&quot;).However, Edison has told us and will tell ESPs today that they intend to very aggressively push the PUC to charge DA customers for &quot;their fair share of the PX credit,&quot; since in their view DA customers (through the negative CTC) &quot;contributed to the undercollection no more and no less than bundled customers did.&quot; They claim they are &quot;on the side of the angels&quot; because it is an &quot;equity&quot; issue, and that allowing DA not to pay would be a massive &quot;jailbreak.&quot;Their calculation is simple:  If DA represents 10% of the load, then DA is responsible for paying down 10% of the undercollection.Edison wants the undercollection recovered over the period of its settlement (they claim that, based on their calculations, they can recover it over 2 years).In short, Edison is zero-ing out payables tied to negative CTC by forcing ESPs/DA customers to pay it back through rates over the next two years.In a conversation yesterday, Edison said that it is not attempting to link the two.  That is, they are not making payment of PX-credit-related debt on agreement by ESPs to pay a portion of Edison s undercollection through rates over the next two years.Presumably, in this way, Edison can say, &quot;We said that we would pay our creditors, and we did.  It was the PUC who sets the rates and decided to claw back by charging ESPs/DA customers as part of the normal course of fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities.&quot; ImplicationsClearly negative from the perspective of expeditiously recognizing earnings for amounts Edison says it will pay us when it pays everyone else in Q1.Equally important, it may increase significantly the risk of recognizing earnings for what PG&amp;E will pay us.  If the PUC addresses whether ESPs/DA customers should contribute to pay down Edison s undercollection, it will likely also want to address the issue for PG&amp;E.  We need to discuss the extent to which the PUC can meddle with PG&amp;E in this regard given that PG&amp;E is pursuing its work out through bankruptcy.Impact on tomorrow s meeting:I still think it is constructive to meet face-to-face with Edison tomorrow, but wanted to give folks the option of doing it by conference call:We still have to determine whether we have agreement on what they owe us.  This includes calculations up to Jan. 17; the period from Jan. 17 to when we put our customers back on bundled service; and the period since they ve been returned to DA status.Since Edison claims they will pay everyone at the same time--sometime in Q1 02--there seems to be some value in determining what that number is, and getting the agreement in writing.Second, it would be useful to explore with Edison why they have chosen to take an extreme, hardball stance on the issue (given that the PX Credit issues represents about $243MM/~$6B = 4-5% of the total debt).In addition, it would be useful to let Edison know that they are in for a very long, protracted litigation struggle if, once they ve paid us, they attempt to take it back through ratemaking shenanigans at the PUC.  In yesterday s conversation with Fielder, I told him that Edison is ensuring World War 3 and that they d better prepare for it if they intend to pursue this unreasonable approach. However, I tried to keep things as cordial as possible in an effort not to close down communications altogether.Other ESPs and DA customers are likely to oppose Edison s proposal.

The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can t?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA &quot;contract&quot;.  (the utilities ask) You d think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood s friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.Sue -----Original Message-----From: 	Smith, Mike  Sent:	Wednesday, November 07, 2001 9:47 AMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Steffes, James D.Cc:	Frazier, Lamar; Blachman, JeremySubject:	CA Extenstions/AmendmentsI heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.

      <data key="e_body">Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.Summary of our offer:Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.Fielder said that he didn t see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff</data>

Nota single cloud in the sky. About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the &quot;Traveler&quot; and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas &quot;Cell-Phone Flop Out.&quot; Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould &quot;flop out&quot; his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:&quot;And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!&quot;He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: &quot;I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.&quot;5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him. Weare all going todie tonight.12:59 We have finished three-quartersof the bottleof Glenlivet. We decide it would be awonderful ideato go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed hasto pee. Hewalks down the hall to our apartmentand directly intothe full length mirror at the end ofthe hall,smashing it into hundreds of pieces.

Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative.

They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&amp;E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  ghhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov/word_pdf/RULINGS/11886.doc</data>

      <data key="e_body">Charlie,	I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it s imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with &quot;adequate assurance&quot; of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit.

Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.

I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.

      <data key="e_subject">Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It</data>
      <data key="e_body">Here is the other article=20How Enron Blew ItLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz &lt;/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php&gt;THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: &quot;From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!&quot;For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. &quot;The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,&quot;= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, &quot;was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.&quot;The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD &quot;a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it.&quot; At Enron, in fact, you either &quot;got it&quot; or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, &quot;someone cou=ld actually get killed.&quot; Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. &quot;I had no idea what I d let go of,&quot; Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. &quot;Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!&quot; he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. &quot;I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling.&quot; Travel: &quot;You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!&quot; Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. &quot;I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,&quot; he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. &quot;It would have been easy to stay,&quot; he says. &quot;But that wou=ld not have been good for me.&quot;=20He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation &quot;bizarre&quot; and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. &quot;I m surprised,&quot; he says, &quot;that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.&quot;PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled &quot;the purchase&quot; was being call=ed &quot;the merger&quot; back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. &quot;Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,&quot; says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. &quot;He never fought change. He embraced change.&quot;Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.=20LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) &quot;I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,&quot; he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call &quot;intellectual capital.&quot; He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them &quot;absolutely compelling.&quot; The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. &quot;Almost to a person,&quot; Skilling says=, &quot;they thought it was stupid.&quot; Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, &quot;Let s go.&quot;The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: &quot;I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough&quot; is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, &quot;We were in=.&quot; And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, &quot;we never looked back.&quot;Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a &quot;knowledge-based business,&quot; which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. &quot;Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,&quot; one former executive explains. &quot;The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.&quot;Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be &quot;a=ggressive.&quot; You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on &quot;Super Saturdays&quot; at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called &quot;a sense =of urgency.&quot; People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. &quot;They were so cutting edge,&quot; rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. &quot;They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.&quot;Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. &quot;If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,&quot; says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. &quot;Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,&quot; one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was &quot;aggressive,&quot; that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. &quot;Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,&quot; the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.&quot;FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,&quot;= sang the New York Times in 1999. &quot;In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,&quot; crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. &quot;Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,&quot; BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them &quot;counterparties.&quot;Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as &quot;mark-to-marke=t accounting,&quot; for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called &quot;subjective accounting,&quot; inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. &quot;Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,&quot; =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: &quot;Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,&quot; he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, &quot;It became a company full of mercenaries.&quot; The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like &quot;I need a smart person-go buy me one&quot; or &quot;Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.&quot; Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became &quot;rank and yank.&quot;) It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, &quot;Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store.&quot; Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =&quot;They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,&quot; says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase &quot;No old tapes&quot; became a=n Enron clich?. &quot;People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,&quot; says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: &quot;They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.&quot;BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. &quot;It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,&quot; an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= &quot;It was the technology era.&quot;To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. &quot;I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,&quot; Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, &quot;They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.&quot;=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: &quot;The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,&quot; he told the press. &quot;Enron is doing extremely= well now.&quot; In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. &quot;For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,&quot; says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. &quot;We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.&quot; (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (&quot;At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.&quot;)But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an &quot;asshole.&quot; When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. &quot;Th=ere wasn t any positive news,&quot; Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. &quot;Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.&quot;The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (&quot;Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?&quot;) The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. &quot;When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,=&quot; says Carol Coale. &quot;When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.&quot;This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. &quot;It just created an attitude,&quot; one executive still at Enron says.= &quot;If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. &quot;=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. &quot;But,&quot; as= one Houston oilman explains, &quot;if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.&quot;As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but &quot;innovat=e much closer to our core.&quot; As for the culture: &quot;Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.&quot;That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. &quot;Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,&quot; one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. &quot;Look,&quot; he s=ays with finality, &quot;ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.&quot;Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. &quot;The first wave never gets it right,&quot; he says. &quot;The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world.&quot; Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it.

      <data key="e_body">Kim, Kelli and Jeff -I have taken a look at the Northern California Power Agency deal, and it looks pretty good from a credit standpoint.  We currently have some exposure to NCPA on the power side, but it rolls off by the end of the year, so I think that we can still get this deal done.  Some outstanding issues:1.  We MUST have a Master Firm in place with NCPA to transact on this deal.  I can begin working on this, but I need to get NCPA s latest financial results to determine an appropriate collateral threshold for NCPA.  This shouldn t be a huge hurdle.2.  We need to ask Jeff Hodge for his opinion with respect to NCPA transacting a deal of this tenor.  There are sometimes tenor limits placed on municipal entities to limit the term under which they are authorized to transact.  Jeff:  How do we research this issue?  NCPA has provided us a brief statement that indicates that &quot;NCPA will work expeditiously to execute a definitive contract and has all the necessary approval authorities&quot;, but my feeling is that we need something a little more substantial than that.3.  Kelli:  Have you spoken with Global Finance to price the embedded loan in this deal?4.  Kim:  I don t think a credit reserve will be needed on this deal.5.  Kim:  From the document that NCPA sent out, it appears that your Monday bid is preliminary and conditional.  We need to make sure that NCPA understands our requirements with respect to executing a Master.  Can your contact at NCPA help me get a copy of their latest financials so we can expedite that process?6.  Kim:  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  NCPA s credit ratings have remained solid throughout the California power crisis, for a number of reasons.  As such, I am pretty comfortable moving forward with this deal, given the above requirements.  However, if their financial results indicate some problems, we may need to include some stringent credit requirements in the Master.  I m pretty sure that their results will look good, but this is a contingency to bear in mind as your prepare your bid.Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks,JRW</data>

EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/25/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major= energy-trading companies.=20Investors appeared worried that Enron s recent woes could have a destabiliz=ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation s t=raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=actions.&quot;Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,&quot; said Merrill Lynch an=alyst Donato Eassey. &quot;There s not a trader out there that doesn t use Enron=Online.&quot; As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =which the company s credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=old head of the company s industrial-markets division. His selection may be= intended, in part, to raise the company s credibility. People familiar wit=h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow s role in running two limi=ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face= of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street= analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=ctions.=20While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as= the company s dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=gements clearly played a role in the executive s departure. &quot;In my continue=d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,&quot; said Ch=airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20Enron said Mr. Fastow &quot;will be on a leave of absence from the company.&quot; He =couldn t be reached for comment.=20It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow s removal will assuage an increas=ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market= close and followed a day in which Enron s stock once again plunged. As of =4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board s most active list at ne=arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =stock.=20Enron s shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,= which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=h different than Enron s, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=ed investment vehicles.=20Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow s departure could= be seen as evidence that &quot;management does care&quot; about investor concerns. H=owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as &quot;an admissi=on of guilt.&quot; Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=gely because of uncertainties about the company s extremely complex financi=al structure.=20Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=.=20Worries and rumors about Enron s financial strength could be found in the s=tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =people voice concerns about a possible &quot;death spiral&quot; in which increasing c=redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn t yet seen any eviden=ce of such a problem.=20However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about= its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=ntities. Enron is facing a problem with &quot;trust and credibility. It s not ea=sy to regain something as basic as trust,&quot; he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Looks at DealingsBy FLOYD NORRIS10/25/2001The New York TimesPage 2, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20  In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear= to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =as C.F.O.,   Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman and chief executive, said in =a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board   continue to have= the highest faith and confidence in Andy.  The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron s industrial market=s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.==20The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=ere Enron s shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion= reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion= write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=en they later learned about it.=20On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the= transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.= Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=ls of the transactions.=20The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron s= disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=.=20By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity= that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=o address.=20Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from= complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=d investors that the company   expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=dity to meet normal obligations,   and said it had bank credit lines that w=ere more than adequate.=20Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow s= successor, was Enron s treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=g, they fell to $16.14.=20One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol= Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to   sell  = from   hold.   She had lowered the rating to   hold   from   buy   on Mond=ay.=20  After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,   she said in an interview yester=day evening,   Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as= a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a= little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.  ==20But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way.   People cou=ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you ll never ge=t any answers.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

During the third-quarter, Enr=on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2= billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected= in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a &quot;Chinese wall&quot; existed be=tween Enron and LJM.=20Fastow s replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron s treasurer befor=e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=he company s industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon= asked to be reassigned from the treasurer s job because he was uncomfortab=le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=or comment Wednesday. He also didn t know whether Fastow is still receiving= a salary.=20Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an &quot;=informal inquiry&quot; into the LJM dealings.=20The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=ling in August for personal reasons.=20A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron s various fina=ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give= analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=es.=20Investors wouldn t like that because it would dilute the value of current o=utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron s debt credit rating may= be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.==20In the last six days, Enron s shares have closed lower and lower.

Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastowamid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry intopartnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader$35 million.

On a recentconference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor interms of calming investors  concerns.       ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC hasgot this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company isrealizing just how concerned investors are.       ``There s always that worry once the SEC gets involved thatit could extend. You never know what could come of that.       ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, withthe SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further assetwrite-downs.       ``Another thing they re criticized for is their lack ofdisclosure.

As details of this dea=l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that= once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=astow is taking a leave of absence. He s been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =formerly CEO of Enron s industrial markets group.=20How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon s a=lleged opposition to Fastow s role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to= show that the &quot;Fastow era&quot; is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained= about Fastow s possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =Fastow couldn t serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that s a positive for Enro=n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal s accoun=t of McMahon s stance on LJM2 was correct.=20Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow s departure shows that it too=k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a= difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=ing. It took Wednesday s plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=he company?=20The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and= Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow s replacement was nec=essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company s core energy trading bu=siness makes money. It s hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge= that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had= not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market s views. =Arguably, that s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent= on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they re unavoidable. The =spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=arency.=20Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20Phew!

Pipeline subsidiary `A-` ratedsenior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. andTranswestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating WatchNegative.The rating action primarily relates to the negative capitalmarket reaction to recent disclosures by the company. Theloss of investor and counterparty confidence, if itcontinues, would impair Enron s financial flexibility andaccess to capital markets, therefore, impacting its abilityto conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announceda $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken inthe third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheetequity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding ofstructured transactions. Since that time, there have beenseveral damaging news reports on the company and itsmanagement. More importantly, investors have voicedconcerns. Enron s common stock price has plummeted andspreads on its debt have widened.The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publiclystated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct itsbusiness. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity isavailable under committed bank lines.An additional concern is that certain structuredtransactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust IIand Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repaymentexist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlyingassets, or an equity offering, primary credit support isderived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorilyconvertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient torepay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120days prior to the maturity date or upon a note triggerevent. In the event that the issuance of the preferredstock yields less than the amount required to redeem thesenior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliveradditional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver onits obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes apayment obligation of Enron, representing a generalunsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgradeof Enron s senior unsecured debt below investment grade byone of the major rating agencies in conjunction withspecified declines in Enron s closing stock price overthree consecutive trading days, Enron would have aforebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt wasbeing made to register the shares. The total amount ofMarlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enronhas not verified that the underlying assets have adequatemarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitchhas no information to indicate that there are anyfundamental problems with Enron s core wholesale, retail,and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contactwith the company on a continuing basis to both monitorongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow10/25/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&amp;P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. &quot;In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,&quot; said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron s Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow s role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to &quot;buy- speculative,&quot; from &quot;buy-high risk&quot;, to reflect his concerns that &quot;lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron s commercial operations.&quot; &quot;This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,&quot; he said. ng/lj For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

(ENE), but they have made almost no changes inpolicies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, thecompanies said Thursday.   The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter ofthe trade in the country s power and gas markets, has seen its share price fallby a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financialstructure.   Moody s has put Enron s credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some ofthe company s debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market thisweek.   &quot;We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,&quot; said JohnSousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). &quot;It s business as usual.&quot;   Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has madeno changes and has no concerns about Enron s credit. Another Top 10 power andgas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.   Other companies expressed concern, though they ve taken little if any action.  &quot;Like everyone else in the marketplace, we re proceeding with caution,&quot; saidLora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the NorthAmerican subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A.   Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn texpect to make any drastic changes.  Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power RevenuesBy Andrew DowellOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/25/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state s wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state s ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. &quot;It s that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,&quot; Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state s role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren t creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn t envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. Willing To Renegotiate Separately, Williams  officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. &quot;We re always willing to sit down with a customer,&quot; Malcolm said. Williams hasn t been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. &quot;To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,&quot; he said. Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron s proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. &quot;That s interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,&quot; Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country s power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. &quot;We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,&quot; Malcolm said. TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp. s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News10/25/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank s decision to leave interest rates unchanged.About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard &amp; Poor s 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. Prior to release of the economic news, S&amp;P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. In addition to pouring over Thursday s economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation s top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant s Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London s Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt s DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan s Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. In Wednesday s session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government s economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&amp;T, which issued weak outlooks. In major U.S. market action Wednesday: Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro. For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased EnronCorp. Common StockNEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. andcertain of the Company s officers and directors in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit isbrought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the commonstock of Enron Corporation (&quot;Enron&quot;) (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the &quot;Class Period&quot;).The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers anddirectors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendantsengaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliatesand interested parties, which disguised Enron s true financialposition.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden fromthe public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improveEnron s balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at anartificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who heldpositions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts ofinterest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from thesetransactions.The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendantsmade misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron sBroadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron s shareprice.  With knowledge that Enron s Broadband business would neverpost a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued tomake misleading statements about the Broadband business in order tomaintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron s Broadbandbusiness to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars infinancing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financingarrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron s earnings,its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron sfinances from its investors and the market, further artificiallyinflating Enron s share price.  While the stock was artificiallyinflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensiveinsider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482million during the Class Period, before the public became aware ofthe above practices.Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and isrepresented by Kaplan Fox &amp; Kilsheimer LLP.

Seventy-six              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred              million in revenues.              James Cramer, guest market commentator:              Maybe.              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize              the whole energy trading arena and...              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you re thinking!  No              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the              California utility system and profited from it.  That s my              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there              we re going to discover this.

Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited              partnership transactions of Mr.--              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking              about.              Cramer:  No, I m saying that this is what, if I were an              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly              what was happening with the electricity market which then              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?              Kernen:  Well, let s talk about the actual news.  Here s              yesterday s trading--              Haines:  Wait a minute.              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.              That s the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that              Fastow, after four--              Faber:  Late yesterday.              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o clock, Fastow is gone.  What s              interesting--              Faber:  He s the CFO--              Kernen:  But he s a new CFO.              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these              off balance sheet partnerships.              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I m not on thin ice here, I m not              on thin ice.              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this              is your theory.              Cramer:  This is my theory.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I              think we ve got to find out more about that short squeeze              that occurred.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now              he s back as CFO and we ll whether that calms the market              down.              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and              those who ve left the company as investors over this last              week have wanted.  Let s see everything; be as transparent              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their              investors, they need to come clean with their trading              counterparties because that is really what people are              concerned about.              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go              down, how would that affect energy trading?              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they re going to be              there on the other side and make good on the trades.              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn t you?              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren t, but why would you--if              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.              Kernen:  Now, why would--              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?              Because of something that could unravel--              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities              they may have--              Kernen:  That they don t know about at this point.              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?              They don t know.  But that s one of the reasons--              Kernen:  We re talking hundreds of millions or billions?              Faber:  They don t know.              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited              partners?              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is              what some analysts estimated.              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets              that they have in the partnerships themselves.              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what s happened              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if              we went back a year, you d see eighty as far as the high              for Enron.  Now we re at sixteen.              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got              hurt.              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don t--  Here we go.              Faber:  I m sorry.  I m getting a little excited.              Kernen:  You are.              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.              Kernen:  There s a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know              what s coming next, don t you?  Now I m worried about the              utility average.  I ve worried about the transportation              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have              replaced my worries.  I m angst-ridden.  Did you see this              chart?  We re breaking below the--              Cramer:  That s a positive, not a negative, Joe.              Kernen:  What s wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?              Cramer:  I m all fired up!              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he s got the DOJ getting              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you              going down to Houston yourself?              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that              whole city.              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that s the--now getting down              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are              retesting those.  That s not something to worry about?              Cramer:  No, because I think there s a lot of money going              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn t say the              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much              stronger than before.              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I              don t--we re talking about four hundred to two-ninety at              this point.  That s a long way.              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but              I still think that--              Kernen:  It s no longer the--              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don t want safety              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.                        # # #</data>

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks toweave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in theirinitial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well asaddress the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs atlevels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to thepresent. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=tphysical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westwardFT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to beserved off the top.

SRP strongly urges each shipperand state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions beforetaking a position in response to the motion.

Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks toweave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in theirinitial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well asaddress the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs atlevels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to thepresent. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=tphysical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westwardFT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to beserved off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodologyset forth in SoCal Gas  initial comments.  It includes North and Southsystem segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits forunprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made toencourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=sdedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=salso made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and togive priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in thesystemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strongsupplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as abasis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiaryhearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system onceimplemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decidewhether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it maybe responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipperand state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions beforetaking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=sbut does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation positionwill only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viablecompromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why itworks.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructivecomments.

      <data key="e_body">Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic &quot;perfect storm&quot; and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state s expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. &quot;If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?&quot; asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. &quot;Good luck!&quot; former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor s plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. &quot;This could save billions of dollars,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis  power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis  legal affairs secretary, said the administration is &quot;not targeting every contract&quot; because the pacts have been &quot;extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.&quot; The governor s aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don t require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18]. [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority s role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority s enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation s unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority s requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman s pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority s siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority s power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. &quot;The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR s] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need.&quot; Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. &quot;Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,&quot; said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state s $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [</data>

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the &quot;Traveler&quot; and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas &quot;Cell-Phone Flop Out.&quot; Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould &quot;flop out&quot; his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:&quot;And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!&quot;He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: &quot;I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.&quot;5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him. Weare all going todie tonight.12:59 We have finished three-quartersof the bottleof Glenlivet. We decide it would be awonderful ideato go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed hasto pee. Hewalks down the hall to our apartmentand directly intothe full length mirror at the end ofthe hall,smashing it into hundreds of pieces. Wegiggleuncontrollably and leave forPollyEsther s.1:17 The PollyEsther s doorman laughsuncontrollablyat our efforts to enter his club.&quot;Fellas,&quot; he saysin between his fits of spasticlaughter, &quot;I ve beenworking this door for almost a year.I ve beenworkingdoors in this town for almost 5 years.And I canhonestly say that I ain t never seenthree drunkermother fuckers than you three.Sorry, can t let youin.&quot; We attempt to reason with him.

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

The notes, which are obligations of the specialpurpose entities, are tied to specific credit events, such as abankruptcy or Enron s failure to pay on obligations.     Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire theTrusts  initial investments, and buyers are to be paid interestfrom the proceeds of those certain assets, according to anoffering memorandum. The Trusts can invest in securities withshort-term ratings of at least ``A1   from S&amp;P and ``P1   fromMoody s Investors Service, as long as they mature before thematurity dates of the notes.     There are four notes, each divided into two offerings, someoffered publicly and some privately sold. All the notes arescheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by agroup of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup.     In the event of an Enron credit event, Citibank, which actedas a swap counter-party to the trusts, can take the trusts investments in return for Enron debt obligations. The Enron debtis then liquidated by the trust, with the proceeds paid to theinvestors.     Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to theholders of the notes, according to an offering memorandum.     Enron s credit-linked notes utilize a credit-default swapthat the trusts have with Citibank that references Enron s seniorunsecured debt, so the rating on the credit-linked notes willreflect the senior unsecured rating, S&amp;P said in a report.--Liz Goldenberg and Terence Flanagan in the New York=20Former SEC Chairman Levitt (Transcript of Interview)2001-11-07 12:52 (New York)     ****THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT.****BLOOMBERG L.P. DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THISTRANSCRIPT.     New York, Nov. 7 (Bloomberg) -- The following is atranscript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Arthur Levitt.  Thereporter is Dylan Ratigan.     RATIGAN:  As you ve probably heard, Enron underinvestigation by the SEC, the SEC looking into partnershipsrun by their former CFO.  If you come into the Bloombergwith me, I want to show you what it s done to the stockprice here over the course of the past month, month and ahalf.  You re talking about a move from a price in the mid40s, which was not that long ago, mind you, early mid-October, to a price that is now $9.67 a share.  This hasabsolutely decimated the company s stock price.  ArthurLevitt, the former chairman of the SEC, with us, looking,first of all, at what s going on with this company.     But, before I do that, let me say good morning to you.     LEVITT:  Good morning, Dylan.     RATIGAN:  Talk to me.     LEVITT:  You know, there are certain warning signs herethat investors have to be careful of:  related partytransactions.  Anytime you see a related party transaction,an investor should be very careful.  What they were doing,was they were simply setting up these partnerships to moveoff the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that wouldreally have hurt the balance sheet and I think giveninvestors a very different picture.     RATIGAN:  Well, let s just make it real clear topeople, because they can easily get confused.  I m acompany.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  .and I create - and I m an executive of thatcompany, and I create a partnership that has nothing to dowith that company, legally, on paper.     LEVITT:  But all the risks and rewards still belong tothe parent company.  The affect of this is the subsidiaryborrows the money to make the acquisition from anotherpartnership set up by the parent. This stays totally off thebalance sheet of the parent company.  Why does this happen?     RATIGAN:  So, in other words, Company ABC exists, theyset up Subsidiary 123.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from.     LEVITT:  To make an acquisition.     RATIGAN:  A bank?     LEVITT:  No.     RATIGAN:  They borrow money from who?     LEVITT:  They issue bonds.     RATIGAN:  OK.  They borrow money from the world.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . whoever wants to lend them money.     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  . they borrow money, they make anacquisition.  Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debtsthat don t reflect upstairs on Company ABC?     LEVITT:  Precisely.     RATIGAN:  But ABC still gets to use the asset that wasbought by 123?     LEVITT:  Yes.     RATIGAN:  OK.     LEVITT:  Exactly.  Now, how does it happen?  Theaccounting firm that handled this transaction, ArthurAndersen, received $25 million for an audit of the company -that s a huge amount - and $27 million for consultingservices - another danger sign.  A lot of dough.  Thoseconsulting services were to validate these transactions; $52million dollars went to the accountants.  The problem hereis an audit committee was not doing its work.  If you lookat Enron s statements - and how many times have we heardthey were confusing?  It s the job of the auditing firm tosee to it that it is not confusing.  That s the realproblem.  Now, what can you do about it?     RATIGAN:  Tell me.     LEVITT:  I think, actually, the FASB, the independentstandards setter, could put through a rule, which says.     RATIGAN:  And FASB is the Federal Accounting StandardsBoard.  They set the rules.     LEVITT:  Yes.  Located in Norwalk, Connecticut.  Theycould say, if a company sets up another legal entity, andthe company retains all the risks and rewards of thatentity, then the public company, that public company thatset up these entities, must consolidate in the P&amp;L, in thebalance sheet, all of these transactions.     Now, how does that come about?  I think the SEC couldurge the FASB to do this.  In 1990, the present chiefaccountant of the SEC called for that action to be takenplace, but at that point, the then-chief accountant didn tsupport the move.     RATIGAN:  And this creates, in your mind, a rallyingcall to reiterate that request with more venom and morepassion than before?     LEVITT:  I don t know about venom, but I.     RATIGAN:  But with passion.     LEVITT:  I certainly think that passion - I think thisis clearly a call for better disclosure.     RATIGAN:  Fair enough.  I will see you next week, OK?     LEVITT:  Good.  Nice to see you.     RATIGAN:  You, too.     ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***USA: U.S. FERC watching Enron s impact on energy markets.11/07/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is w=atching what effect Enron Corp. s financial problems may have on interstate= electricity and natural gas markets, FERC chairman Pat Wood said on Wednes=day.=20However, Wood said FERC does not have a direct role in the ongoing federal =investigation of the company.&quot;We re watching the impact that Enron or any other firm would have on the o=verall workings of the market, but we re not intervening where other agenci=es have jurisdiction,&quot; Wood told reporters during a briefing after the agen=cy s regular meeting.=20Enron, the nation s largest trader of natural gas and electricity, is under= attack for failing to explain off-balance sheet transactions that led to a= $1.2 billion write-down of shareholder equity.=20The deals, conducted with partnerships run by ousted Chief Financial Office=r Andrew Fastow, are under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchang=e Commission.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of t=he charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited =partnerships which were controlled by Enron s chief financial officer and t=hat the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder eq=uity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. When this news hit th=e market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly.=20Plaintiff is represented by the law firm of Rabin &amp; Peckel LLP.

S&amp;P also added a &quot;Watch neg=ative&quot; designation, meaning the rating agency is poised to issue further do=wngrades if warranted.=20&quot;The CreditWatch placements recognize the uncertainties that surround the c=ompany and its credit quality in the short run due to the possibility of fu=rther anticipated developments in the capital markets,&quot; the rating agency w=rote.Wednesday s downgrade affects $500 million worth of notes, which are deriva=tives linked to Enron s senior unsecured debt, now rated BBB.&quot;The investors are taking the risk of Enron credit&quot; by purchasing the secur=ities from the trusts even though these are not issued by Enron,&quot; said Tom =Fritz, a Standard &amp; Poor s managing director.In addition, Standard &amp; Poor s cut to BBB Yosemite Securities Co. Series 20=00-A. The obligations use Enron s corporate rating as a backstop.=20The counterparty to Yosemite and the credit-linked notes is Citibank, Fritz= said. Last week, J.P. Morgan joined with Salomon Smith Barney, which along= with Citibank is a unit of Citigroup (C: news, chart, profile), to extend =$1 billion in new credit to Enron to help the company s liquidity. Not business as usual &quot;With these downgrades, it s not business as usual,&quot; the energy trader said=. &quot;We re already in the process of losing a counterparty that contributed a= good deal of liquidity to the energy-trading market.&quot;The trader cited Calpine (CPN: news, chart, profile), Dynegy (DYN: news, ch=art, profile), and El Paso Energy (EPG: news, chart, profile) as energy tra=ders that have a chance to gain market share, but he conceded that Enron wo=n t be replaced overnight, should it cease to exist.&quot;Energy trading won t be destroyed at all,&quot; the trader said. &quot;It will certa=inly be diminished but not gone.&quot;What Enron s absence would do is make it more difficult for lesser creditwo=rthy companies to participate in the market.

The United States Justice Foundation intends to sue inSacramento County Superior Court, said Richard D. Ackerman, leadcounsel on the case for the group. The USJF wants a court toterminate the long-term power contracts and require money alreadypaid to the generators to be returned to the state.     The USJF proposes a class action to represent Californiataxpayers and alleges violations of the state s business and open-meeting laws. Ackerman said his group may need to forge new law tosucceed in the case.     ``You re gonna have some serious legal battles that may go tothe appeals level in this case,   Ackerman said.     California officials last spring signed about $43 billion inlong-term power contracts after two investor-owned utilitiesbecame insolvent. Governor Gray Davis has said the contracts wereneeded to bring stability to California s energy market. Sincethen, the cost of power has dropped, leaving California withcontracts to buy electricity above spot-market prices.     Enron Corp., Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas&amp; Electric Company, Green Mountain Energy, San Diego Gas &amp;Electric Company, Reliant Energy Company, PacifiCorp PowerMarketing, Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, and Calpine Energy Companyhave electricity contracts with the state, according to a USJFpress release.     The USJF said it sent a letter to California officials givingthem notice of its intent to sue. The group, which calls itself``Your conservative voice in the courts   on its Web site, issupported by individual donations, Ackerman said.--Michael B. Marois in Sacramento (916) 503-1612</data>

Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz &lt; &lt;http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=.php&gt;&gt;=20THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron s simple if grandiose goal: &quot;From the World s =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World s Leading Company!&quot;For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. &quot;The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,&quot;= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation s energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, &quot;was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets.&quot;The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn t possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California s ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company s global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD &quot;a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it.&quot; At Enron, in fact, you either &quot;got it&quot; or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling s River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room s white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric s masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine s best CEO s in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, &quot;someone cou=ld actually get killed.&quot; Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. &quot;I had no idea what I d let go of,&quot; Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother s wedding. &quot;Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!&quot; he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. &quot;I m interested in the kids. You don t do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling.&quot; Travel: &quot;You can t go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!&quot; Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. &quot;I m not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO s job,&quot; he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. &quot;It would have been easy to stay,&quot; he says. &quot;But that wou=ld not have been good for me.&quot;He s a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation &quot;bizarre&quot; and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. &quot;I m surprised,&quot; he says, &quot;that people have so much trouble understa=nding this.&quot;PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn t help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn t know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn t have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG s pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled &quot;the purchase&quot; was being call=ed &quot;the merger&quot; back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company s center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. &quot;Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future,&quot; says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. &quot;He never fought change. He embraced change.&quot;Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) &quot;I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,&quot; he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn t deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call &quot;intellectual capital.&quot; He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan s McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them &quot;absolutely compelling.&quot; The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. &quot;Almost to a person,&quot; Skilling says=, &quot;they thought it was stupid.&quot; Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, &quot;Let s go.&quot;The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: &quot;I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough&quot; is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling s =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company s CEO was under fifty, &quot;We were in=.&quot; And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, &quot;we never looked back.&quot;Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn t work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a &quot;knowledge-based business,&quot; which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron s employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you d expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. &quot;Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die,&quot; one former executive explains. &quot;The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.&quot;Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be &quot;a=ggressive.&quot; You were right for Enron if you didn t want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on &quot;Super Saturdays&quot; at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called &quot;a sense =of urgency.&quot; People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company s first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn t a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn t live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn t be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company s personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron s Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. &quot;They were so cutting edge,&quot; rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. &quot;They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going.&quot;Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn t really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. &quot;If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money,&quot; says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company s faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. &quot;Every time he d speak, I d believe everything he =d say,&quot; one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America s largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was &quot;aggressive,&quot; that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron s generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. &quot;Mr. Skilling s experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,&quot; the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another.&quot;FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,&quot;= sang the New York Times in 1999. &quot;In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,&quot; crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron s entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company s marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn t that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn t lose. &quot;Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,&quot; BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company s hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them &quot;counterparties.&quot;Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy s new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as &quot;mark-to-marke=t accounting,&quot; for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron s= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn t ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called &quot;subjective accounting,&quot; inves=tors didn t particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren t =going to be high enough. &quot;Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,&quot; =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron s compe=ting literacy charity: &quot;Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,&quot; he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, &quot;It became a company full of mercenaries.&quot; The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron s domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change s Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like &quot;I need a smart person-go buy me one&quot; or &quot;Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.&quot; Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn t get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC s nickname qu=ickly became &quot;rank and yank.&quot;) It was a point of pride that Skilling s divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, &quot;Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store.&quot; Skilling s approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers  att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =&quot;They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future,&quot; says one former employee. Anyone who couldn t close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase &quot;No old tapes&quot; became a=n Enron clich?. &quot;People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,&quot; says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren t necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: &quot;They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death.&quot;BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world s leading energy =company into the world s leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. &quot;It wasn t the tim=e for long-term approaches,&quot; an Enron executive says of Wall Street s mood.= &quot;It was the technology era.&quot;To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO s job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune s list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron s goals=, and Skilling s impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn t mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling s contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron s entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world s greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark s resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. &quot;I think it s best for Rebecca to start= afresh,&quot; Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, &quot;They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business.&quot;=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: &quot;The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well,&quot; he told the press. &quot;Enron is doing extremely= well now.&quot; In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO s job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron s domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS s Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron s political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company s jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron s management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron s claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. &quot;For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us,&quot; says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. &quot;We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn t put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.&quot; (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling s al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. (&quot;At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.&quot;)But the biggest problem was Enron s telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron s most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn t cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron s financial reporting an &quot;asshole.&quot; When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron s accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. &quot;Th=ere wasn t any positive news,&quot; Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. &quot;Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.&quot;The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. (&quot;Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?&quot;) The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron s possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. &quot;When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they re forgiving of something like accounting,=&quot; says Carol Coale. &quot;When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight.&quot;This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. &quot;It just created an attitude,&quot; one executive still at Enron says.= &quot;If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of  We re above everyone else. &quot;=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. &quot;But,&quot; as= one Houston oilman explains, &quot;if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn t have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that s better suited for good times than bad.&quot;As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO s office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but &quot;innovat=e much closer to our core.&quot; As for the culture: &quot;Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem.&quot;That Skilling s supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling s lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he d always been contemptuous of the long haul; he d always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. &quot;Even Jeff s biggest detra=ctors wouldn t have wanted him to walk out the door,&quot; one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. &quot;Look,&quot; he s=ays with finality, &quot;ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.&quot;Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. &quot;The first wave never gets it right,&quot; he says. &quot;The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn t work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world.&quot; Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld s center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space.&quot;This is the second wave, and Enron s got it,&quot; he says, almost breathless. =&quot;There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it.&quot;</data>

      <data key="e_body">State s Electric Bill Gets LighterEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.By MIGUEL BUSTILLOTimes Staff WriterOctober 20 2001SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won t see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state s power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state s energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state s large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state s economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department s power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a &quot;jailbreak,&quot; Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state s power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state s power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration s latest numbers. &quot;Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,&quot; said Pete Garris, who oversees the department s power-buying division. &quot;Put simply, the PUC s delay in suspending direct access means [the state s] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.&quot; State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the &quot;stampede&quot; of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that s happened to consumers in this energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said. And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. &quot;The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. &quot;Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place.&quot; But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission s figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration s request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. &quot;If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts.&quot; Also adding to the state s financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan s interest rates. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state s planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on StrategyIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. &quot;I don t think it s real smart to tell you that,&quot; said Barry Goode, the governor s legal affairs secretary.</data>

      <data key="e_body">FYI.  If I ve missed anyone who might be interested, please forward along.Best,JeffCALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS Friday, October 19, 2001[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and fuel cells at [18]. [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority s role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority s enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation s unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority s requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman s pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority s siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority s power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. &quot;The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR s] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need.&quot; Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. &quot;Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,&quot; said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state s $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [</data>

[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority (from [1]) Is the California Power Authority a dangerously out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting back some state control over electricity supplies? The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the Power Authority s role thus far in carrying out the letter and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal authors of the Power Authority s enabling legisla-tion, SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the Energy Foundation s unpaid role in devel-oping the Power Authority s requests for bids, particularly the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and heads of other agencies the Power Authority must work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed Power Authority board chair David Freeman s pro-posal to have it buy peaker output. California Energy Commission members said they are at policy odds with the Power Authority s siting plans. In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said that the Power Authority s power-wind and fossil peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not able to respond quickly enough to balancing power needs. &quot;The letters of intent already approved by the Power Authority could far exceed [DWR s] ability to ab-sorb that power given the outlook for net-short need.&quot; Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority power will be via contract, not the spot market. &quot;Selling on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,&quot; said Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently in the position of actually being able to acquire new energy as the state s $12.5 billion bond issue to underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in limbo and the California Independent System Operator is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic house in order, and an Assembly investigation might jeopardize that [J.A. Savage]. [</data>

We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.  If you have not talked with him, I would suggest that you do so.  Sally W.

      <data key="e_body">Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor?When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC s president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis  long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the &quot;energy crisis,&quot; an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch s behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. A lengthy article in Monday s Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it s just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor s backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it s the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis  knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. Holding up approval of the administration s bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he ll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.</data>

If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.</data>

      <data key="e_body">Power providers cry foul over fees State is accused of improper billing Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California s energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis  administration. The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. &quot;The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,&quot; Smutney-Jones said. An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to &quot;bury&quot; some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. &quot;The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,&quot; Ackerman said. The governor s spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms  accusations &quot;absolutely false&quot; and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state s affairs. &quot;The generators know they ll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,&quot; Maviglio said. &quot;It shouldn t be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement.&quot; Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California s energy crisis. &quot;I don t feel sorry for them one bit,&quot; Hidalgo said. &quot;They had one heck of a year.&quot; Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers  bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can t comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California s grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO s 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board. In February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become &quot;a political arm of the governor.&quot; The commission is trying to get California to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization. Davis has warned Washington to &quot;keep its hands off&quot; the ISO.</data>

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?

      <data key="e_subject">PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison</data>
      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.

Enquiry stemming from original  94 Marathon complaint (also root of GFU investigation); revived this year.What have we done: Very little (though EC aware of parallel EFET effort under German NTPA discussions), except answer questionnaires sent earlier this year about EU-wide terms of access and a more recent questionnaire (at least under EFET umbrella) about concessions offered by Thyssengas. Now stepping up effort using external counsel in Brussels and engaging German country manager.</data>

      <data key="e_body">As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy s permission in order to engage in such discussions.  I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.  Given Dynegy s presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn t look like the want to divest of the pipes.  This is Greg s call. -----Original Message-----From: 	Donahue, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, November 13, 2001 1:55 PMTo:	Whalley, Greg; McMahon, Jeffrey; Horton, StanleyCc:	Muller, Mark S.Subject:	Greg, Jeff and Stan:I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy s consent.Jeff</data>

In the nine monthssince December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. Thedecade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only fiveyears ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distantmemory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TVsets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With nodemand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer priceindex, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead andthere is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sectoris shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in humanmemory.In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried tofind a place, however humble, in the organised sector of theeconomy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risenby another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confidentthat a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all ofthe country s problems.But one recent event highlights the government s paralysis moresharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is itsfailure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of theMaharashtra State Electricity Boards s attempt to foil Enron sbid to take it before an international arbitration court byclaiming that a case was pending before an Indian courtchallenging the arbitration clause in the power purchaseagreement.The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government sinternational obligations as defined by the Treaty or theagreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,proceedings in an international court must take precedence overthose in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been clearedfor India to face the humiliation of being dragged before aninternational tribunal for a breach of it contractualobligations.Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron s lawyers, both thosewhom they retain and those who drafted the power purchaseagreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEBwill lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservativeestimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs anddamages. In addition it will have to spend a little more tocomplete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project islikely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute hasdragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this wassimply a dispute between a State Government and a privatecompany, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in anycase wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. Buttoday it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was becauseneither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the billwill, inevitably land at the Centre s door. And that means thetaxpayer s door.The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? Theanswer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do istransfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to completeand operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion powerplant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too willinsist on the capital value of the project being substantiallywritten down first. Judging from the offers that the TataElectric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity SupplyCompany (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value willnot exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, thecountry will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for thatmatter anything else) in return.None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enronprobably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Raogovernment agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor isit intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government thathad it only brought the Maharashtra government and moreparticularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginningthe latter s inability under law to pay backup charges at morethan twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plantswould have been exposed long ago.But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justifyeven greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, theEnron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As aserious, responsible government that knows the importance ofhonouring one s word in a world where contract is king, theVajpayee Government must honour the country s contractualobligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying toalter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did notsee, but by definition all future changes must be by mutualconsent.The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol s poweraffordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committeeand the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buythe $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into aseparate company that can supply gas to all the current andfuture users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one betterand bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and managethe plant. This is entirely feasible because its installedcapacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. Thiswill bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges andcost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of theequity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreignexchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicingrepresents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairmanof BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupeedebt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricitytariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oilhaving fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changeswill bring down the cost of Dabhol s power at 90 per centcapacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will makeit entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and theneighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in theaverage power tariff or are able to bring down power theft andreduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.The right course for the centre even at this late stage will beto take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it withEnron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from itat cost and make the above structural changes on its own beforehanding it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court willneither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol s power nor answerthe more basic question - how can any electricity grid add newpower plants to itself without raising the average tariff itcharges for electricity.Copyrights: 1995 - 2001 The HinduRepublication or redissemination of the contents of this screen are expresslyprohibited without the consent of The Hindu</data>

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production.

MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, &quot;We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent s Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.&quot; Regent President John Ehrman said, &quot;The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.&quot; The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent s core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.</data>

Nota single cloud in the sky. About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the &quot;Traveler&quot; and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas &quot;Cell-Phone Flop Out.&quot; Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould &quot;flop out&quot; his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:&quot;And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!&quot;He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: &quot;I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.&quot;5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him. Weare all going todie tonight.12:59 We have finished three-quartersof the bottleof Glenlivet. We decide it would be awonderful ideato go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed hasto pee. Hewalks down the hall to our apartmentand directly intothe full length mirror at the end ofthe hall,smashing it into hundreds of pieces. Wegiggleuncontrollably and leave forPollyEsther s.1:17 The PollyEsther s doorman laughsuncontrollablyat our efforts to enter his club.&quot;Fellas,&quot; he saysin between his fits of spasticlaughter, &quot;I ve beenworking this door for almost a year.I ve beenworkingdoors in this town for almost 5 years.And I canhonestly say that I ain t never seenthree drunkermother fuckers than you three.Sorry, can t let youin.&quot; We attempt to reason with him.

It s an excerpt from an analyst s noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset &amp; debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management713-214-4355</data>

      <data key="e_body">For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I m ashamed to admit th=at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a=nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem=ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el=se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati=on the Employee s have received over the last few years about values such a=s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten=ded to get Employee s to believe Senior Management really supported these v=alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som=ething just the opposite.I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n=ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha=ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t=he statement &quot;It s just a balance-sheet issue&quot;  implies to me that this ind=ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa=inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga=me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen=t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua=ting values in some of Enron s broadband telecommunications and other techn=ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini=tion of the word &quot;HEDGE&quot;.  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an=d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski=ng customers to let Enron help them &quot;HEDGE&quot; their risk when I m not sure En=ron s Senior Management understands what a hedge means?I m also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= &quot; do as I say not as I do&quot;? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =their word?The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=ion is &quot;CRIMINAL&quot;.  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.

Nota single cloud in the sky. About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the &quot;Traveler&quot; and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas &quot;Cell-Phone Flop Out.&quot; Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould &quot;flop out&quot; his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:&quot;And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!&quot;He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: &quot;I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.&quot;5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him. Weare all going todie tonight.12:59 We have finished three-quartersof the bottleof Glenlivet. We decide it would be awonderful ideato go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed hasto pee. Hewalks down the hall to our apartmentand directly intothe full length mirror at the end ofthe hall,smashing it into hundreds of pieces. Wegiggleuncontrollably and leave forPollyEsther s.1:17 The PollyEsther s doorman laughsuncontrollablyat our efforts to enter his club.&quot;Fellas,&quot; he saysin between his fits of spasticlaughter, &quot;I ve beenworking this door for almost a year.I ve beenworkingdoors in this town for almost 5 years.And I canhonestly say that I ain t never seenthree drunkermother fuckers than you three.Sorry, can t let youin.&quot; We attempt to reason with him. Helaughsharder.1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. Wetake twosteps in the door and hear &quot;Last callfor alcohol!&quot; Iturn to the group and mutter: &quot;See, datwasn t thatfuckin  hard. Day don t fuckin  do thatat theAwamo...the awaom...thealab...fuck it, that stadiumwewas at today...&quot; We order 6 shots oftequila andthree beers.2:15 Back on the street.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

Jim -----Original Message-----From: =09Gold, Joe =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:38 AMTo:=09McMahon, Jeffrey; Sherriff, JohnCc:=09Kitchen, Louise; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Brown, Michael - COO London; Gol=d, Joe; Derrick Jr., James; Farmer, Michael; Heffron, Kevin; Hutchinson, Mi=chael; Jones, Timothy; Lynch, DrewSubject:=09EML Capital Adequacy and LiquidityJeff / John,We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =let us know.Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe GoldIntroductionEnron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. = EML is one of Enron s two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron s only remaining b=rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron s other b=usinesses:1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML s p=olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML s cond=uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship= to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=e FSA and the LME.3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=d to protect against systemic risk, EML s position as a provider of liquidi=ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=ease carrying on business.4)=09EML s board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for= a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines= and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members= under the FSA s rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=elating to directors  duties.Directors Overriding Ring Fencing ObligationIn the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.Issues Surrounding LiquidityAs we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was= concerned =20The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains= and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,= it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its= day to day liquidity.=20=20In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it= must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=ions.Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from= the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC s, which were primarily used in lieu of c=ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC =s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be= transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML s cash balance.  Was the re=maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=ity impact.The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =agreed to start to do the followinga.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=he rest of the enterpriseb.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control= as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnelc.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints= of continuing to do business on a normal basisd.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basise.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidityf.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basisOperational Risk =20In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =needs.  EML s board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=f EML relied on Enron Corp. s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either= capital or liquidity events as EML s clearing account at Citibank would be= substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=ght create a cascade for Enron, EML s board is reluctant to put that much f=aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.CapitalAs noted above, EML is subject to the FSA s regulatory capital rules and mu=st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions= when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the= FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=se from Enron s perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=L s cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =basis, EML s board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress TestingThe stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral= rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =brokers4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=205)=09Credit exposures leading to credit lossesRecommendationsThe result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following= changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=erall operational liquidity1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=ubordinated facility2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=ty by six months to July 20024)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=ts and other assets held by EML5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch= to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=d for calling margin6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=an a select group of key relationship clients=207)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory financeCurrent SituationUnsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mmSecured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mmSubordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mmEML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mmCash required to replaceWithdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128%Excess Reg.

Sent:	Friday, October 26, 2001 11:47 AMTo:	Haedicke, Mark E.; Schuler, Lance (Legal); St. Clair, Carol; Murray, Julia; McCullough, TravisSubject:	This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours. The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.</data>

      <data key="e_body">As I said yesterday it is my understanding that we need Dynegy s permission in order to engage in such discussions.  I however have not seen the final merger documents so I may be mistaken.  Given Dynegy s presentation to the analysts on Monday it doesn t look like the want to divest of the pipes.  This is Greg s call. -----Original Message-----From: 	Donahue, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, November 13, 2001 1:55 PMTo:	Whalley, Greg; McMahon, Jeffrey; Horton, StanleyCc:	Muller, Mark S.Subject:	Greg, Jeff and Stan:I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy s consent.Jeff</data>

On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).

As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?Thanks,Tom -----Original Message-----From: 	Hemsley, Simon  Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 12:04 PMTo:	Shah, Rajen; Jordan, Kevin D; Doukas, Tom; Wall, DavidCc:	Drew, RachelSubject:	FW: Investment companiesI will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?in the meantime (and don t shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEFbroker account to have a new name - see company below -----Original Message-----From: 	Wall, David  Sent:	26 September 2001 15:45To:	Hemsley, SimonSubject:	FW: Investment companiesWe must move Anker as a matter of urgency.

I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron s corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.Regards,Kevin</data>

Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An=dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele=ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners  review. Withdrawn partner=s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11=/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was= scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will= be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN=GTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills  cash flow= and COS model and prepare comments.Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM=Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, =and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a=ll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio=n points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp=act on the toll.1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has= 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5=% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f=or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews= need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op=inion on this, Bryan?2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati=on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be= underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w=ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed =by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No=rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer=ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo=othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis=ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca=sh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service =model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr=ying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le=velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat=er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc=t me if I am wrong here, Tim.3) OM &amp; A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=w (OM&amp;A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =Capex).4) The Withdrawn Partners  historical contributions ($228 million) will be =added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee= of $40 million should be included in the project budget.5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but= some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=s.6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=g 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=g, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=ial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c=alculate AFUDC more accurately.7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will= be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=e unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches= with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=208) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=struction period should be added.=20Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=ng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan s email. =20Thanks,=20JB=20Jebong Lee=20713-853-9722 office=20713-306-8658 cell</data>

It is poss=ible they will ask for additional information. =20=20Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6=.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to swee=p the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped b=y the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to re=imburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron s ultimate outflow will= be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to altern=ative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and pol=itical implications.=20Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elekt=ra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are wor=th noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) wi=ll likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can t get bid bonds on its o=wn although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM s mar=ginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been m=apped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit &quot;one-sided&quot; in favor of the distri=butor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the =distco to change terms without success. =20=20Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can t work with us.  Operationall=y, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI s fuel su=pplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We =are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.=20Ecoelectrica:This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process: = Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst=and that Mirant s insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Le=nders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio=n coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lend=ers appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% o=f the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional= $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic=k back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi=th QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week a=nd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender= s agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le=nder group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to prov=iding comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have =reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to s=ending their &quot;versions&quot; of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday ni=te (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th=at the documents are &quot;conforming&quot;.  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to final=ize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfillin=g CP s as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we= can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can c=lose CP s by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed l=ight on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi=gate further. =20=20APACHI =20=20Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg=otiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas=t enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday s New York event.  Nevert=heless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen=t date; funding wouldn t occur until early next year.=20=20Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting the=m over the hump on the issue of Enron s contingent obligation to cover the =potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings h=ave been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project. ==20=20China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely c=auses still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Wor=k on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with =Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approa=ched us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits= to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayme=nt ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation. =20=20Europe =20=20Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to pr=ovide limited technical support and financial services support to help put =in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction act=ivities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligatio=ns.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE s $9 million of guar=antees. =20=20Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good= meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government =stated they would &quot;clean up&quot; arrears but could not do so before January 200=2 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to wor=k with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the =legal opinion they had sought and received didn t address the issue properl=y and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backin=g it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Governme=nt &quot;terms of reference&quot; on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of= change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they woul=d expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed pos=ition against it. =20=20Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor s c=laim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on No=vember 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at th=e plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials. =20=20ENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over =final completion certificate.

      <data key="e_body">Best of luck with your meeting today.  You see this story?  Most interesting quotes I ve seen yet from Watson.Best,Jeff***********************************************Business/Financial Desk; Section CTHE MARKETSSuitor for Enron Receives Approval From Wall St.By ALEX BERENSON11/13/2001The New York TimesPage 13, Column 1c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWall Street found nothing but good news in Dynegy s $9 billion takeover of the Enron Corporation yesterday. Three days after Dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in Houston, agreed to take over Enron, its giant crosstown rival, Dynegy executives came to New York to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company s profits. They met a receptive audience.Dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. Since last Wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, Dynegy s stock has risen more than one-third. Enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. After some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted Dynegy s view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. Enron s stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as Enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. But Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that Enron s problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. He largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that Enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations.   There s nothing wrong with Enron s business,   Mr. Watson said in an interview at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors.   The people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.   Enron s immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, Mr. Watson said. A $1.5 billion cash infusion from Dynegy should restore the confidence of Enron s business partners and keep Enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. To bolster Enron further, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. The potential investments by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup were reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Watson said Dynegy would also move quickly to assuage Enron employees who are angry that Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as Enron s shares plunged.   Right now, there s some animosity over there,   he said. Many employees at Enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. The company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the Department of Justice. Mr. Watson predicted that the deal would lift Dynegy s earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. Analysts backed that view yesterday.   Investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,   said Thomas Hamlin, an analyst at Wachovia Securities. Mr. Hamlin said he believed that Dynegy had obtained Enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price.   It s not too often you get to take out the No. 7 Fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,   he said.   My guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.   The deal could increase Dynegy s earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at the Williams Capital Group.   That s a whopper,   he said.   It s a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for Enron.   Mr. Lay said in an interview that Enron had been forced to sell itself because of   the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.     We realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,   he said.   A good company was being badly tarnished.

      <data key="e_body">1.	Dynegy vs. ComEd at FERCDynegy filed a complaint at FERC that tries to disallow Firm LD from being used by marketers under the ComEd Network Service.  IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year.2.	MISO vs. ARTOIP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won t state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to &quot;go physical&quot; starting next year in Illinois.3.	CTC Bet in ComEdMy recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn t happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.4.	Delivery Service Tariff LitigationComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.5.	PPO (Power Purchase Option) TerminationComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to &quot;deliver&quot; today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?6.	Relative Size of Current EES BookComEd	=	7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)IP	=	1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)Hope this helps.  Data will improve with more time.Jim</data>

It is reasonably sound as f=ar as &quot;history of the formation&quot; is concerned but some of their statements =and conclusions I have to take issue with. =20Off the top of my head, they use the term &quot;idle&quot;.  In my mind as a utility =person, idle means available but just not running.  As they apply the term,= they use it to describe any unit not running, either because it was forced= off or was off for maintenance, I realize it s only a word, but it carries= many different inferences, mostly unfavorable.  Early in the document they= refer to possible abuses of market power and the generators withholding su=pply to manipulate the price.  They never substantiate this claim.  In fact= as they proceed though the rest of the paper they build up a good case sho=wing how a series of circumstances actually lead to shortages and high pric=es, but if a busy staffer only read the beginning they never would have und=erstood the full picture.  They also don t really touch on the lack of supp=ly side response.

The group will likely file the joint appeal by the end of this week or first thing next week.3) In addition, folks will submit separate comments on or around Dec. 3rd to the Commission regarding:a) the legal reasons to support the argument that the commission doesn t have the legal authority to ask parties to turn over contracts, and,b) the policy reasons to support the argument that the Commission doesn t need specific contracts, or contract language, to implement the suspension of DA effectively.  Edison s Proposal to Implement the Settlement It Reached with the PUC in Order to Avoid Bankruptcy.A local consumer group (&quot;TURN&quot;) protested Edison s filing. TURN told the Commission that the proposal requires signficantly more time, scrutiny and analysis than Edison would allow under its proposed schedule.We re likely to support TURN s suggestion that considerably more time and scrutiny are required since Edison s proposal could have a significant effect on EES  book in California.Will distribute additional information as it happens. If you have any questions, don t hesitate to contact us.Best,Jeff</data>

Gray Davis. The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor s power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state s power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. &quot;The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they re not renegotiated,&quot; Commissioner Richard Bilas said. &quot;I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.&quot; The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &quot;It s definitely not something that s a favorable thing to have happen to us,&quot; said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. &quot;It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,&quot; Hidalgo said. &quot;If that s the goal, then we re back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.&quot; The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTSTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis  energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier s parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn t comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC s challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor s three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis  attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER S WARNINGState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC s actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. &quot;We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,&quot; Lynch said last week. &quot;We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission s challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch s fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don t rule out Davis  bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. &quot;The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if we renegotiate, we ll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.&quot; Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. &quot;Now another California agency is disputing it,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;We obviously disagree, and we ll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.&quot; PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGSThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. &quot;News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,&quot; the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state s energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis  solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison s finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************</data>

The Attorney General s office recently said it doesn t plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state s $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state s energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI&gt;, news &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI&gt;, msgs &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI&gt;) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE&gt;, news &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE&gt;, msgs &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE&gt;) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.</data>

      <data key="e_body">Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.Summary of our offer:Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.Fielder said that he didn t see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis  hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.Davis  proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis  proposed rate agreement.What is Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis  proposal?With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California s General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.Safe to say that today s PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to &quot;solving&quot; California electricity crisis in shambles.What Next?A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.The bill would create a &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR s costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison s rates)The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison s capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structureEdison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the &quot;filed rate doctrine&quot; and 2) the so-called &quot;TURN&quot; accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.Edison agrees to &quot;cooperate&quot; with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the &quot;special&quot; session that the Governor recently announcedWe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 2:45 PMTo:	Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic &quot;perfect storm&quot; and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state s expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. &quot;If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?&quot; asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. &quot;Good luck!&quot; former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor s plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. &quot;This could save billions of dollars,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis  power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis  legal affairs secretary, said the administration is &quot;not targeting every contract&quot; because the pacts have been &quot;extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.&quot; The governor s aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don t require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

Barry Goode, Davis  legal affairs secretary, said the administration is &quot;not targeting every contract&quot; because the pacts have been &quot;extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.&quot; The governor s aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don t require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

      <data key="e_body">Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic &quot;perfect storm&quot; and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state s expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. &quot;If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?&quot; asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. &quot;Good luck!&quot; former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor s plan.

      <data key="e_body">State s Electric Bill Gets LighterEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.By MIGUEL BUSTILLOTimes Staff WriterOctober 20 2001SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won t see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state s power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state s energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state s large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state s economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department s power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a &quot;jailbreak,&quot; Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state s power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state s power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration s latest numbers. &quot;Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,&quot; said Pete Garris, who oversees the department s power-buying division. &quot;Put simply, the PUC s delay in suspending direct access means [the state s] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.&quot; State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the &quot;stampede&quot; of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that s happened to consumers in this energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said. And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. &quot;The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. &quot;Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place.&quot; But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission s figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration s request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. &quot;If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts.&quot; Also adding to the state s financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan s interest rates. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state s planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on StrategyIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. &quot;I don t think it s real smart to tell you that,&quot; said Barry Goode, the governor s legal affairs secretary.</data>

      <data key="e_body">State s Electric Bill Gets LighterEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.By MIGUEL BUSTILLOTimes Staff WriterOctober 20 2001SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won t see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state s power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state s energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state s large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state s economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department s power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a &quot;jailbreak,&quot; Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state s power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state s power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system.

      <data key="e_body">State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau &lt;mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com&gt;Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: &lt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL&gt;Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state s three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. &quot;Circumstances have changed,&quot; said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. &quot;Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market.&quot; Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis  administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn t adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides  numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.</data>

I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don t want to attract new business in a given market doesn t mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.Thanks,JimPS - I ll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status. -----Original Message-----From: 	Herndon, Rogers  Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 1:34 PMTo:	Kingerski, Harry; Steffes, James D.Subject:	FW: IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness IssuesWho should respond to Janet s specific IL request? -----Original Message-----From: 	Herndon, Rogers  Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 1:32 PMTo:	Dietrich, JanetCc:	Ogenyi, Gloria; Bradford, William S.; Hughes, Evan; Gahn, Scott; Blachman, Jeremy; Wood, James M.; Leff, Dan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Sharp, VickiSubject:	RE: IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness IssuesWe are not managing bonds, etc.  This is a market entry requirement and should be documented by Product Development/Services upon entering new markets.

Will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together.  This is one of the issues I have been hammering on re: new product development/new market entry - I want proof of all data requirements/costs/license requirements/processes before new products are released and markets are entered.  In the past, I believe sign offs have occurred without a complete understanding of the requirements.

The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.Enron s Credit Rating of BBB(S&amp;P), and Baa2(Moody s)General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.Registration Under SubPart B:EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB- (Duff 	&amp; Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES  revenue for last fiscal year; or		3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES s revenue for the last fiscal year; or	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES  contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or		5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an &quot;A&quot; rated financial 	insitution; or		6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.Enron s Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&amp;P) and Baa2 (Moody s), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES s ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.Single Bill Option:Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an &quot;A&quot; rating	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&amp;P), Baa3 (Moody s), BBB-(duff &amp;Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)		4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.Enron s Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp s current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month s estimated IFC charges for all EES  customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES  customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP s service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.</data>

I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don t want to attract new business in a given market doesn t mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.

The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.Registration Under SubPart B:EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more.

It hasn t. MATTHEW C. QUINN STAFF Nov. 4, 2001 Atlanta Journal/Atlanta Constitution Home Page E.1 (Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001) Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there s widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. Instead, here s what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter s record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.&quot;No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they ve had to go through,&quot; said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably &quot;swimming against the tide.&quot;Georgia s relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.&quot;There s plenty of blame to go around here,&quot; she said, noting that &quot;never in the history of Georgia&quot; has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has &quot;profound concerns&quot; about the impact on consumers.Barnes said he s not out to scrap deregulation. That s a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.Many of them haven t paid since last winter s frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, &quot;it was a lot easier&quot; to straighten out problems, Coveny said. &quot;We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships.&quot;High pricesJessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state s top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that &quot;the computer messed up.&quot; She s been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion s service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she &quot;yelled and screamed&quot; and complained to the PSC. &quot;I have to have gas,&quot; she said. &quot;I have seven children.&quot; Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.&quot;If people don t pay us in 45 days, they get a notice,&quot; Benfield said. &quot;In most cases they pay.&quot;The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.&quot;People aren t being treated right,&quot; says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. It s not clear &quot;how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation,&quot; said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.Reeling from bad debtResidential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light s distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL s charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what s authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it s entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it s hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia s gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn t pay their bills. While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they d recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. &quot;California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power,&quot; said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.When Georgia s moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.&quot;You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality,&quot; Darby said.Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia s No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is &quot;circling the wagons.&quot;Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia &quot;has not been an exciting profit picture for us,&quot; but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: &quot;Unless things get better, no company can survive this.&quot;Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state s top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. &quot;It s not been a good business for us,&quot; said Rosput of AGL.No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it s in for the long term.New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia s natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn t like the idea. The company s stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it s not planning to pull out.Still, there s concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.PSC member Baker already sees an &quot;oligopoly&quot; with limited competition. Consumer choice &quot;is supposed to be the hallmark&quot; of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, &quot;consumers have less and less.&quot; Re-regulation  callsSo far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. Calls for &quot;re-regulation&quot; are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.&quot;We can t let Georgia consumers suffer for another year,&quot; said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the  97 law, said he s concerned about gas prices, but he s not sure re-regulation is &quot;doable at this point.&quot;Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. &quot;We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have,&quot; saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: &quot;If it s re-regulated, who takes the ball?&quot; says PSC Chairman Lauren &quot;Bubba&quot; McDonald Jr.Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.Then there s the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a &quot;bailout&quot; to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for &quot;fixing&quot; deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.Rosput said she s &quot;prepared to get to a solution,&quot; but like everyone else, she doesn t have an answer.&quot;It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship,&quot; she said, &quot;and there s no safe shore or good place to land.&quot; 713-853-9287 888-703-0309</data>

Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR s costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison s rates)The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison s capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structureEdison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the &quot;filed rate doctrine&quot; and 2) the so-called &quot;TURN&quot; accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.Edison agrees to &quot;cooperate&quot; with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the &quot;special&quot; session that the Governor recently announcedWe will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 2:45 PMTo:	Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.Summary of our offer:Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.Fielder said that he didn t see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.Summary of our offer:Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.Fielder said that he didn t see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff</data>

Thanks.Best,JeffState PUC seeks to void Davis s power contracts Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine California s hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor s power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state s power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. &quot;The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they re not renegotiated,&quot; Commissioner Richard Bilas said. &quot;I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.&quot; The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &quot;It s definitely not something that s a favorable thing to have happen to us,&quot; said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. &quot;It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,&quot; Hidalgo said. &quot;If that s the goal, then we re back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.&quot; The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTSTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis  energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier s parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn t comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC s challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor s three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis  attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER S WARNINGState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC s actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. &quot;We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,&quot; Lynch said last week. &quot;We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission s challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch s fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don t rule out Davis  bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. &quot;The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if we renegotiate, we ll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.&quot; Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. &quot;Now another California agency is disputing it,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;We obviously disagree, and we ll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.&quot; PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGSThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. &quot;News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,&quot; the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state s energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis  solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison s finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************</data>

The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis  energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier s parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn t comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC s challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor s three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis  attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER S WARNINGState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC s actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. &quot;We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,&quot; Lynch said last week. &quot;We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission s challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch s fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don t rule out Davis  bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. &quot;The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if we renegotiate, we ll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.&quot; Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. &quot;Now another California agency is disputing it,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;We obviously disagree, and we ll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.&quot; PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGSThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. &quot;News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,&quot; the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state s energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis  solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison s finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************</data>

Underlying these transactio=ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short =time.=20In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore= Transwestern  s negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market= price differentials between the California border and producing basins in =New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading= Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant= Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2=7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl=uding surcharges and fuel.=20In Transwestern  s case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc=rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu=ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: &quot;Did Trans=western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und=er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate=d rate charges at substantially higher rates?&quot; (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10=.)=20Background=20Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to =its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-=1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian=t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens=erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener=gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus=pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,= 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti=ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric= Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=egon-California border.=20According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum= FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=y may be available on the GTN system.=20GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.= Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =the company s website and EBB, consistent with the Commission s regulations=.=20Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:==20- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity= arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to= pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&amp;E s citygate=, or the Southern California border market.=20- Dynegy s rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested= it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN s information, Dynegy believe=d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it &quot;a prici=ng opportunity.&quot;=20- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN s response did not allow for the total volu=me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission s 5/1/01 o=rder.=20- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=eld to Malin.=20- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=.=20FERC Has Serious Concerns=20According to the September 13 order, GTN s negotiated rate transactions und=er investigation &quot;present several serious concerns.&quot; Even with the addition=al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=er consistent with GTN s tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper s standing in= the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN s =posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is= awarded.=20Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =negotiated parties  representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC s concerns go to the Se=mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=mission surmises.Mark McConnellTranswestern Pipeline Company713-345-7896   office713-822-4862   cell713-646-2551   faxmark.mcconnell@enron.com</data>

The transactions established transportation rates ti=ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric= Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=egon-California border.=20According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum= FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=y may be available on the GTN system.=20GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.= Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =the company s website and EBB, consistent with the Commission s regulations=.=20Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:==20- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity= arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to= pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&amp;E s citygate=, or the Southern California border market.=20- Dynegy s rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested= it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN s information, Dynegy believe=d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it &quot;a prici=ng opportunity.&quot;=20- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN s response did not allow for the total volu=me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission s 5/1/01 o=rder.=20- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=eld to Malin.=20- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=.=20FERC Has Serious Concerns=20According to the September 13 order, GTN s negotiated rate transactions und=er investigation &quot;present several serious concerns.&quot; Even with the addition=al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=er consistent with GTN s tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper s standing in= the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN s =posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is= awarded.=20Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =negotiated parties  representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC s concerns go to the Se=mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=mission surmises.Mark McConnellTranswestern Pipeline Company713-345-7896   office713-822-4862   cell713-646-2551   faxmark.mcconnell@enron.com</data>

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, &quot;We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent.

Ilayered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some ofthe gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt termto 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported forthat length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion ofthe gap.	However, we are still short of our target and my calculationsindicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lastingthrough year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  Allin all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we arelooking at.Mark,	Could you review from TW s perspective and see if you come up withnumbers in the same ball park?Robert ProffittBusiness DevelopmentNatural Gas Pipeline CoPhone:  713-369-8856Fax:  713-369-9365</data>

      <data key="e_body">I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our &quot;positive&quot; CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their &quot;goofy&quot; arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that s a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren t talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.Jim -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 6:18 PMTo:	Curry, WandaCc:	Steffes, James D.; Tribolet, MichaelSubject:	RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC PaidNeed to think about it a bit.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!Wanda -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October  23, 2001 5:19 PMTo:	Steffes, James D.; Curry, Wanda; Tribolet, MichaelSubject:	RE: Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC PaidWanda:  I faxed the examples that Edison faxed us and that you and Michael and I talked about some time back.

If you need another copy, let me know.  Question:  I don t know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the &quot;netting&quot; through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----From: 	Steffes, James D.

Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here s what he said:They plan to &quot;settle&quot; with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1 02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility s undercollection and that the ESP s share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge s recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison &quot;meet and confer&quot; with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on &quot;getting ESPs paid&quot; and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison s stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn t assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, theprice cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) issimply bad economic policy and won t address any problems--in fact itwill only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I m not evensure that the Commission can successfully &quot;regulate&quot; prices in thesecondary market.)Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decisionbased comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have beenon record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policyand pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think thatit s very important to point out the downside of caps and to be onrecord against them.That said, I don t want the comments to be so negative as to cloudsupport for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change thecap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps areill-advised?Best,Jeff	-----Original Message-----	From: MDay	Sent: Thu 10/18/2001 8:43 PM	To:  Amirault, Paul ;  Jeff Dasovich Enron SF ;  MichaelAlexander, SCE ;  Phil Davies, WGSI Calgary ;  Porter, Douglas K 	Cc:	Subject: I. 99-07-003 Draft Comments on the Revised ProposedDecision	 &lt;&lt;X28621.DOC&gt;&gt;	Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the RevisedProposed	Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can t?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA &quot;contract&quot;.  (the utilities ask) You d think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood s friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.

SEC Looking Into Possible Conflict on Interest atEnronBy Stephen TaubThe Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that Enron provideinformation regarding certain related party transactions. &quot;We welcome this request,&quot; said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO in aprepared statement. &quot;We will cooperate fully with the SEC.&quot; Enron, North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas andelectricity, noted that its internal and external auditors and attorneysreviewed the related party arrangements, the Board was fully informed of andapproved these arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company s SECfilings. &quot;We believe everything that needed to be considered and done inconnection with these transactions was considered and done,&quot; Lay added. As we noted on Friday, a limited partnership organized by chief financialofficer Andrew Fastow racked up millions of dollars since 1997 in profitsfrom transactions conducted with the energy company, according to The WallStreet Journal. The partnership reportedly renegotiated the terms of dealswith Enron in ways that boosted its financial positions or reduced its riskof losses. REPORT: E&amp;Y REVENUES NEARLY HALVEDLater this week, Ernst &amp; Young will announce that its revenue growth wasnearly halved in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the FinancialTimes. Specifically, the Big 5 professional services firm will report that revenuesrose by 7.2 percent to $9.9 billion for the year. In fiscal 2000, revenuesclimbed by 14.1 percent, and by 13.5 percent the prior year. The reason for the drop in revenue growth may be that E&amp;Y fetches most ofits business from the United States, and the U.S. economy tanked in thefirst half of this year. &quot;We have been successful this year, despite the economy and during a periodof great challenge and change in our profession,&quot; chairman James Turley toldthe FT. Rival Andersen has already reported that revenues rose 10 percent this yearthrough August 31. Another reason for E&amp;Y s revenue retrenchment: the strong dollar. The firmis expected to announce that revenues increased 12.4 percent in localcurrency terms, according to the paper. Turley told the FT that his clients are less focused on the longer term andare instead concentrating on watching expenses, cash management, debtcovenant issues, and security concerns. &quot;We re going to see more covenantviolations and that will drive restructuring issues,&quot; Turley told the FT.

      <data key="e_body">Dan Walters: As California s malaise deepens, Gray Davis  standing plummets (Published Oct. 7, 2001) A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. Davis  high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they re looking for someone to blame. Davis  approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. The seriousness of Davis  decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. Davis  chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. How big the state budget hole will become is anyone s guess. There s a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis  problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. However large the state s fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration s demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. It s apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis  own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature s proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities  purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he ll veto the measure. The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis  months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor s claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians  increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned.   _____  The Bee s Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com &lt;mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com&gt;.</data>

      <data key="e_body">Mike:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won t address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I m not even sure that the Commission can successfully &quot;regulate&quot; prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.   But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it s very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.   That said, I don t want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

      <data key="e_body">State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau &lt;mailto:lgledhill@sfchronicle.com&gt;Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: &lt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/20/MN39027.DTL&gt;Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state s three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. &quot;Circumstances have changed,&quot; said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. &quot;Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market.&quot; Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis  administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn t adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides  numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.</data>

      <data key="e_body">State s Electric Bill Gets LighterEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.By MIGUEL BUSTILLOTimes Staff WriterOctober 20 2001SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won t see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state s power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state s energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state s large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state s economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department s power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a &quot;jailbreak,&quot; Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state s power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state s power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration s latest numbers. &quot;Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,&quot; said Pete Garris, who oversees the department s power-buying division. &quot;Put simply, the PUC s delay in suspending direct access means [the state s] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.&quot; State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the &quot;stampede&quot; of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that s happened to consumers in this energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said. And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. &quot;The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. &quot;Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place.&quot; But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission s figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration s request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. &quot;If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts.&quot; Also adding to the state s financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan s interest rates. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state s planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on StrategyIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. &quot;I don t think it s real smart to tell you that,&quot; said Barry Goode, the governor s legal affairs secretary.</data>

      <data key="e_body">State s Electric Bill Gets LighterEnergy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.By MIGUEL BUSTILLOTimes Staff WriterOctober 20 2001SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday. Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added. The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won t see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation. Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state s power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans. Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state s energy contracts. California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state s large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state s economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers. In August, state officials estimated the department s power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion. But in what consumer groups angrily called a &quot;jailbreak,&quot; Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state s power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state s power costs. Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to ConsumersThe PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis. However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration s latest numbers. &quot;Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,&quot; said Pete Garris, who oversees the department s power-buying division. &quot;Put simply, the PUC s delay in suspending direct access means [the state s] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.&quot; State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the &quot;stampede&quot; of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity. &quot;What s happened here is one of the most damaging things that s happened to consumers in this energy crisis,&quot; Angelides said. And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis. &quot;The PUC first gave Edison their bailout,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, referring to the legal settlement recently approved by the commission to rescue the utility. &quot;Now we find that big business is in effect getting bailed out of the energy crisis. These were the two groups, the big business guys and the utilities, that got us in this mess in the first place.&quot; But Lynch, the PUC president, said the number conflicted with the commission s figures, which showed direct access participation at roughly 8% of the overall load. That, she said, was similar to the number of businesses participating in direct access at the beginning of the year, a little more than 7%, before the energy crisis erupted. It fell to a low of 2% during the crisis because some energy companies realized they could make more money on the open market and breached their deals with state businesses, she said. Lynch accused Angelides and the Davis administration of revisionist history, saying the commission postponed its decision at the administration s request. The commission then put off the decision again because the Legislature was considering its own solution to the problem, she said. The real problem, Lynch said, is that the state has too much electricity under contract at too high a price. If California had not purchased too much power, consumers would not have to pay for it, she said. &quot;If people are leaving the system, those are fewer people [the state] needs to serve,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;The problem, once again, is the long-term contracts. We need to renegotiate these contracts.&quot; Also adding to the state s financial burden is the fallout from a $4.3-billion energy loan the state took out this summer that it will not be able to repay in time, driving up the loan s interest rates. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the state s planned $12.5-billion energy bond sale to replenish the billions spent from the state budget on electricity this year. But the bond deal is now in limbo, in part because the PUC has refused to take action on a rate agreement that is required for the bond sale to move forward. As a result, a series of escalating interest rates spelled out in the loan deal are being triggered, which will soon force the Department of Water Resources to make payments to the bankers from its reserve. Davis and Aides Stay Tight-Lipped on StrategyIn a related development, the newly created state public power authority, headed by S. David Freeman, met Friday to consider approving millions of dollars worth of energy conservation and generation projects, but none were adopted because the authority learned it had no money to finance them. If the bond deal ever takes place, the state may be in a position to meet its financial obligations and possibly lower utility rates, which were raised this year in response to the energy crisis. The state may also have the option of floating a smaller bond, though advisors to the governor called that less likely. In another action that could reduce rates, Davis administration officials confirmed Friday that they are planning to renegotiate some of the long-term power contracts, as The Times reported Thursday. The contracts have been criticized by consumer groups and some legislators for being inflexible and expensive. But Davis advisors remained tight-lipped on the specifics, saying only that they have a strategy to convince power companies to open talks. &quot;I don t think it s real smart to tell you that,&quot; said Barry Goode, the governor s legal affairs secretary.</data>

      <data key="e_body">Governor wants to cut costs of power Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO -- With an economic &quot;perfect storm&quot; and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state s expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. &quot;If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?&quot; asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis  chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. &quot;Good luck!&quot; former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor s plan. Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. &quot;This could save billions of dollars,&quot; said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis  power contract renegotiation plan. Barry Goode, Davis  legal affairs secretary, said the administration is &quot;not targeting every contract&quot; because the pacts have been &quot;extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.&quot; The governor s aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don t require them to reopen negotiations with the state. The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state s power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. The liability is compounded due to the pacts  potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing &quot;perfect storm&quot; of fiscal calamities. The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state s most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. Burton has called &quot;for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.&quot; The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California s future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California s annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. &quot;We re not going to say no. We d certainly sit down at the table with them and say,  Let s see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that, &quot; said Calpine s Cartwright. If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be &quot;very, very severe,&quot; but also &quot;they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,&quot; Cartwright said. His comments coincided with reports that Calpine s third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine s performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. Heller, one of the state s most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis &quot;is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.&quot; &quot;Last spring,&quot; Heller said, &quot;power companies had a gun to the governor s head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.&quot;</data>

      <data key="e_body">Jim:Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:1) Coordinate PG&amp;E/SCE2) Edison &quot;meet and confer&quot; (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder s coordinating.2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov t affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.We have a number yet for the call?Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_subject">Power providers cry foul over fees -- Cal ISO/DWR price manipulation?</data>
      <data key="e_body">Power providers cry foul over fees State is accused of improper billing Electricity suppliers long accused of manipulating California s energy market are turning the tables on the state, saying its independent grid manager is forcing them to make up the cost of bad energy deals signed by Gov. Gray Davis  administration. The power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legally required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping state power buyers spread out the cost of high-priced electricity contracts. Energy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mysterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney- Jones of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such industry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant. The charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resources was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an average of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour. &quot;The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Water Resources is giving them,&quot; Smutney-Jones said. An industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing a formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been improperly charged. The commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid management agency. State officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared California could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the state had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot market suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought. Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said the grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing practices to &quot;bury&quot; some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the accounts of other generators. &quot;The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control the governing board of the ISO,&quot; Ackerman said. The governor s spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms  accusations &quot;absolutely false&quot; and said the generators were trying to whip up sentiment in Washington to interfere with the state s affairs. &quot;The generators know they ll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in Washington than they will in Sacramento,&quot; Maviglio said. &quot;It shouldn t be a surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement.&quot; Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said generators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California s energy crisis. &quot;I don t feel sorry for them one bit,&quot; Hidalgo said. &quot;They had one heck of a year.&quot; Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a response to the accusations. Energy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mechanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs. The extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers  bills for ISO operating costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said. Some firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for resale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more expensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate stand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can t comply, they say, the ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra cost. The accusations are part of a struggle for control of California s grid. In January, Davis disbanded the ISO s 26-member governing board, which was chaired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with industry. Davis appointed his own five-member board.

Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch s behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval.

The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he ll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging.

      <data key="e_body">FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.Best,JeffBattle lines drawn over long-term power deals SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state s power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&amp;E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state s electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state s economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress allegedConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. &quot;We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,&quot; said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. &quot;We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal.&quot; Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers  Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. &quot;The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,&quot; Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. &quot;Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,&quot; Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California s electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. &quot;To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,&quot; said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. &quot;There were other means to manage the emergency.&quot; The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. &quot;First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,&quot; said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to dealAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are &quot;just and reasonable.&quot; FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. &quot;In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,&quot; said Steve Maviglio, the governor s spokesman. &quot;We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.&quot; Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission s action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. &quot;The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,&quot; said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fairThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. &quot;It s pretty tough to say,  Let s renegotiate the lowest price contract,  &quot; Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra s contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. &quot;There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,&quot; White said. &quot;The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. &quot;But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don t we ask?&quot; *****************************************************************State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it s too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01SACRAMENTO -- California s new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority s goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency s rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. &quot;We re dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What s up with that? It s absolutely ludicrous,   said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers  Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year s, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. &quot;The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,   said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: &quot;We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.&quot; New contracts would increase  green  power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state s energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called &quot;peaker   plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service.

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&amp;E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. Or maybe not. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state s electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state s economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. Duress allegedConsumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. &quot;We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,&quot; said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. &quot;We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal.&quot; Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers  Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. &quot;The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,&quot; Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. &quot;Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,&quot; Shames said. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. He says California s electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. &quot;To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,&quot; said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. &quot;There were other means to manage the emergency.&quot; The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. &quot;First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,&quot; said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.Willingness to dealAt least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC.

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. &quot;In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,&quot; said Steve Maviglio, the governor s spokesman. &quot;We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.&quot; Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission s action as a step toward revising the agreements. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. &quot;The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,&quot; said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. Sempra says contract fairThe company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. &quot;It s pretty tough to say,  Let s renegotiate the lowest price contract,  &quot; Niggli said. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra s contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. &quot;There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,&quot; White said. &quot;The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. &quot;But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don t we ask?&quot; *****************************************************************State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it s too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01SACRAMENTO -- California s new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority s goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency s rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. &quot;We re dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What s up with that? It s absolutely ludicrous,   said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers  Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year s, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. &quot;The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,   said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: &quot;We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.&quot; New contracts would increase  green  power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state s energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called &quot;peaker   plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts.

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. &quot;There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,&quot; White said. &quot;The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. &quot;But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don t we ask?&quot; *****************************************************************State authority buying more power for 2002 Critics say it s too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss OC Register, 10.07.01SACRAMENTO -- California s new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority s goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency s rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. &quot;We re dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What s up with that? It s absolutely ludicrous,   said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers  Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. In a normal summer, such as this year s, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. &quot;The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,   said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. Said Freeman: &quot;We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.&quot; New contracts would increase  green  power In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state s energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called &quot;peaker   plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn t completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state s power portfolio. That assessment won t be done until February. &quot;I hope they have a basis on which they ve determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,   said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them Even the state s businesses are critical. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they ve negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. &quot;I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,   said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis  closest advisers during the energy crisis. The Legislature s auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. &quot;It s not an investigation,   said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But &quot;it s appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.   Keeley s committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority s actions could help or hurt the state. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state s work. &quot;The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,   Freeman said. &quot;Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.  </data>

Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers. The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday. Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed. &quot;There is no deal between us and the generators at this point,&quot; Bryson said. &quot;We will engage promptly&quot; in settlement discussions. &quot;We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way.&quot; Ted Craver, Edison s chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt. Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade &quot;immediately.&quot; &quot;We ve had some discussions with the credit rating agencies,&quot; Bryson said. &quot;But no one expects it to be restored immediately.

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_subject">PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison</data>
      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state s negotiations, according to a press release Monday. The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companiesWe believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state s electricity contracts were made in violation of California s conflict of interest laws,&quot; said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. &quot;If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void.&quot; Three weeks after Budhraja s January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB&gt;, news &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB&gt;, msgs &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB&gt;) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn t said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. &quot;It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,&quot; Ahern said. &quot;It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.&quot; The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc.

The Attorney General s office recently said it doesn t plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state s $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state s energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI&gt;, news &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI&gt;, msgs &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI&gt;) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE&gt;, news &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE&gt;, msgs &lt;http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE&gt;) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.</data>

Thanks.Best,JeffState PUC seeks to void Davis s power contracts Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators In a move that could undermine California s hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor s power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state s power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. &quot;The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they re not renegotiated,&quot; Commissioner Richard Bilas said. &quot;I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.&quot; The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &quot;It s definitely not something that s a favorable thing to have happen to us,&quot; said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. &quot;It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,&quot; Hidalgo said. &quot;If that s the goal, then we re back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.&quot; The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTSTaken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis  energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier s parent company. Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. Davis  spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn t comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. The PUC s challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor s three appointees. The commission has rebuffed Davis  attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. STATE TREASURER S WARNINGState Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC s actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. &quot;We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,&quot; Lynch said last week. &quot;We should stay as flexible as possible. Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission s challenges to the contracts. Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch s fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don t rule out Davis  bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. &quot;The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if we renegotiate, we ll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.&quot; Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. &quot;Now another California agency is disputing it,&quot; Mitchell said. &quot;We obviously disagree, and we ll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.&quot; PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGSThe PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. &quot;News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,&quot; the PUC said. An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state s energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis  solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison s finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation. ***************************************************</data>

Jim -----Original Message-----From: =09Gold, Joe =20Sent:=09Wednesday, November 07, 2001 10:38 AMTo:=09McMahon, Jeffrey; Sherriff, JohnCc:=09Kitchen, Louise; Bowen Jr., Raymond; Brown, Michael - COO London; Gol=d, Joe; Derrick Jr., James; Farmer, Michael; Heffron, Kevin; Hutchinson, Mi=chael; Jones, Timothy; Lynch, DrewSubject:=09EML Capital Adequacy and LiquidityJeff / John,We have drafted a note relating to the business operations of Enron Metals =Limited (EML). As you know we have been particularly concerned about watchi=ng our cash position and thought that it would be of benefit for you to und=erstand the unique situation that EML has from a regulatory standpoint. Aft=er your review, we would be happy to set up a meeting to discuss. If you co=ncur with the actions suggested, please advise.  If there is any balance sh=eet, debtor/creditor or cash forecast information that you require, please =let us know.Drew Lynch, Kevin Heffron, Jonathan Marsh, and Joe GoldIntroductionEnron Metals Limited  (EML) maintains a unique position within Enron Corp. = EML is one of Enron s two businesses regulated by the UK Financial Service=s Authority (FSA - the UK financial regulator) and Enron s only remaining b=rokerage business.  Given its special status, EML has responsibilities to i=ts clients that are codified and enforced by the rules of the FSA and the L=ME (metals exchange) of which it is a member.  As a result of this regulato=ry oversight, there are several differences between EML and Enron s other b=usinesses:1)=09EML must conduct its business in compliance with prescriptive regulato=ry rules relating, among other areas to capital adequacy and conduct of bus=iness. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in d=isciplinary action being taken against the company itself and its officers.2)=09By virtue of its position as an LME broker, there are certain circumst=ances in which EML is regarded as acting as agent for its clients.  EML s p=olicy has been to avoid acting as agent where possible; however, EML s cond=uct is evaluated by the FSA in light of the potential for that relationship= to exist.  How EML conducts itself with clients is tightly regulated by th=e FSA and the LME.3)=09Because the FSA has a duty to protect the orderliness of UK markets an=d to protect against systemic risk, EML s position as a provider of liquidi=ty and the potential for it to disturb the market through its conduct or la=ck of conduct is also an area for concern with the FSA and the LME. As a co=nsequence of this concern, the FSA requires regulated entities to maintain =prescribed amounts of capital to protect against certain risks such as posi=tion and credit risk. The rules relating to regulatory capital require FSA =regulated firms to calculate a financial resources requirement in accordanc=e with rules and to maintain financial resources in excess of this requirem=ent. These rules are prescriptive as to the types of capital, which can be =used by way of regulatory capital, and a breach of these rules is regarded =as extremely serious. An ongoing ability to meet a financial resources requ=irement usually results in the FSA issuing an order requiring the firm to c=ease carrying on business.4)=09EML s board members and its traders are subject to direct regulatory o=versight by the FSA and can be disciplined in their individual capacity for= a breach of the rules. Penalties for individuals include significant fines= and possible expulsion from the industry. The duties owed by board members= under the FSA s rules are in addition to those owed under general UK law r=elating to directors  duties.Directors Overriding Ring Fencing ObligationIn the light of recent developments there is a premium on being able to dem=onstrate to the FSA that, to the full extent possible, the financial streng=th of EML is ring-fenced from any financial problems being encountered by t=he rest of Enron.  In order to make certain that we fulfil this obligation =we have changed the way we do business in the ways discussed below.Issues Surrounding LiquidityAs we are all aware over the past week, as a result of the reputation probl=ems the corporation has been faced with, we have substantially increased th=e hands on financial and managerial oversight of EML.  This was a precautio=n against knock on problems causing liquidity issues for EML.  Clearly the =goal was to be able to feel absolutely certain that the financial standing =of EML was fully and completely ring- fenced from any problems related to t=he non-EML related problems of Enron.  This of course needed to be accompli=shed within the framework of continuing to be a fully integrated Enron comp=any as far as shared services and inter company commercial relationship was= concerned =20The FSA does not regulate the method under which a regulated entity obtains= and distributes its cash.  In the event, that cash is lent outside of EML,= it must be collateralised by an LC in order to preserve the regulatory cap=ital of the firm; however, the firm has a number of options to preserve its= day to day liquidity.=20=20In its position as an LME broker, EML must have access to cash for two purp=oses.  First, it must be able to post margin to the London Clearing House (=LCH).  In the event that liquidity ever prevented EML from posting collater=al to the LCH, it would be in breach of the LCH rules and regulatory enforc=ement action could ensue. In addition it would be declared a defaulter and =the LCH would have the right to close out all of its positions.  Second, it= must be able to post margin to its clients.  A failure to make a contractu=al payment to a client would likely result in FSA action if it were referre=d to the FSA.  A third potential use of cash is to make payments to in-the-=money clients in the event that they wish to close their account.  While th=ere is no contractual right for a client to cash in their mark-to-market pr=ofits, the failure of EML to make such payment would cause reputation quest=ions.Previously, we believed there were only a small number of potential scenari=os where we might be faced with not having sufficient liquidity. However ce=rtain significant components of these scenarios have unfortunately come to =fruition and the amount of cash maintained by EML and its ring fencing from= the rest of Enron has become a concern.  EML has or is in the process of l=osing $60,000,000 of unsecured LC s, which were primarily used in lieu of c=ash at the LCH.  EML has had to use its cash to replace or secure those LC =s.  Additionally, a number of clients have requested that their accounts be= transferred.  Those transfers have reduced EML s cash balance.  Was the re=maining $50 mm unsecured LC (which has been issued by a single bank) to be =withdrawn we are not currently in position to immediately manage the liquid=ity impact.The work done and the events of this past week have highlighted the need fo=r being fully prepared for any foreseeable eventuality.  Therefore we have =agreed to start to do the followinga.=09Change the way our financing works so as to maintain our excess liquid=ity on our own balance sheet rather than being a provider of liquidity to t=he rest of the enterpriseb.=09Improve our overall cash management function so as to have the control= as well as the oversight be the direct responsibility of EML personnelc.=09Manage the business so as to maximize liquidity within the constraints= of continuing to do business on a normal basisd.=09Obtain financial information on a much more timely basise.=09Periodically perform a number of analytical stress scenario tests so a=s to be certain that we continue to have sufficient internal liquidityf.=09 Undertake to formalize arrangements with EMGL for provision of additi=onal liquidity whether on an unsecured subordinated or senior basis when ou=r own liquidity is insufficient to run the business on normal basisOperational Risk =20In theory, EML could be run on a small cash balance held in its own account=s and rely on Enron Corp. for the remaining portion of its day to day cash =needs.  EML s board have been resistant to this practice for several very p=ractical reasons.  First, it is possible that the LCH could unexpectedly ca=ll on EML to provide a large amount of collateral on an immediate basis.  I=f EML relied on Enron Corp. s daily wire transfer for its liquidity needs, =it would be in danger that either a liquidity shortfall at Corp. or an acco=unting or administrative error somewhere in the system could trigger either= capital or liquidity events as EML s clearing account at Citibank would be= substantially overdrawn.  Given the likelihood that an LCH or FSA event mi=ght create a cascade for Enron, EML s board is reluctant to put that much f=aith in the 100% accuracy of our operational safeguards.CapitalAs noted above, EML is subject to the FSA s regulatory capital rules and mu=st calculate its financial resources on a daily basis.  The FSA requires th=at EML notify it if its capital base is less than 110% of the minimum finan=cial resources requirement.  For a variety of reasons, there were occasions= when EML violated the 110% threshold on occasions in 2001. Because these v=iolations were self-contained and easily remedied the FSA did not take enfo=rcement action and EML instituted an internal procedure whereby it maintain=s financial resources in excess of 120% so that it has a sufficient buffer =not to trigger the FSA notification requirement. In the current climate the= FSA has expressed concerns about the possible systemic risk that might ari=se from Enron s perceived financial weakness. Accordingly, if one of those =violations occurred today, the FSA would likely commence a formal investiga=tion of EML and could issue an order requiring EML to cease trading in ligh=t of the need to reassure the FSA and in light of the sizable changes in EM=L s cash position and client positions that have been occurring on a daily =basis, EML s board has been attempting to maintain a regulatory capital lev=el of 130%.  Clearly the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and exces=s capital adequacy go hand in hand. =20Liquidity and Capital Adequacy Stress TestingThe stress testing noted above has been based on the following types of sce=narios, which would cause liquidity issues for EML1)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by internal or exte=rnal clients for whom we either provide credit or receive margin collateral= rather than cash resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH2)=09Changes in market prices causing additional losses by the EML house ac=count resulting in EML financing these losses at the LCH3)=09Clients with credit balances transferring those balances to other LME =brokers4)=09Withdrawal of LCH letters of guaranty by the providing banks and the i=nability to replace the bank guaranty on an unsecured basis resulting in ca=sh being placed either with the issuing bank or the LCH directly=205)=09Credit exposures leading to credit lossesRecommendationsThe result of the stress testing has been to make us consider the following= changes to the way we do our business in addition to trying to increase ov=erall operational liquidity1)=09To fully draw down the remaining $25 mm available under the  $125 mm s=ubordinated facility2)=09To monetize the inter-company marked to market positions (+$20 mm)3)=09To increase the subordinated facility to $175 mm and extend the maturi=ty by six months to July 20024)=09To monetize to the degree possible all external marked to market profi=ts and other assets held by EML5)=09To stop providing credit for in house Enron counterparts and to switch= to a either one way or mutually margining with a zero or very low threshol=d for calling margin6)=09To stop providing or reduce the amount of credit for clients, other th=an a select group of key relationship clients=207)=09To continue to move large physical positions to the physical trading c=ompanies (EMCL and EMCC) therefore shifting the need for inventory financeCurrent SituationUnsecured Guaranty=09=09=09$65 mmSecured Guaranty=09=09=09$15 mmSubordinated Loans=09=09=09$107 mmEML Cash Balance:=09=09=09$59 mmCash required to replaceWithdrawn guaranty=09=09=09($20mm)EML Regulatory Capital Level:=09128%Excess Reg.

In the nine monthssince December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. Thedecade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only fiveyears ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distantmemory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TVsets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With nodemand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer priceindex, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead andthere is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sectoris shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in humanmemory.In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried tofind a place, however humble, in the organised sector of theeconomy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risenby another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confidentthat a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all ofthe country s problems.But one recent event highlights the government s paralysis moresharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is itsfailure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of theMaharashtra State Electricity Boards s attempt to foil Enron sbid to take it before an international arbitration court byclaiming that a case was pending before an Indian courtchallenging the arbitration clause in the power purchaseagreement.The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government sinternational obligations as defined by the Treaty or theagreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,proceedings in an international court must take precedence overthose in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been clearedfor India to face the humiliation of being dragged before aninternational tribunal for a breach of it contractualobligations.Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron s lawyers, both thosewhom they retain and those who drafted the power purchaseagreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEBwill lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservativeestimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs anddamages. In addition it will have to spend a little more tocomplete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project islikely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute hasdragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this wassimply a dispute between a State Government and a privatecompany, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in anycase wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. Buttoday it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was becauseneither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the billwill, inevitably land at the Centre s door. And that means thetaxpayer s door.The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? Theanswer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do istransfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to completeand operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion powerplant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too willinsist on the capital value of the project being substantiallywritten down first. Judging from the offers that the TataElectric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity SupplyCompany (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value willnot exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, thecountry will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for thatmatter anything else) in return.None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enronprobably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Raogovernment agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor isit intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government thathad it only brought the Maharashtra government and moreparticularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginningthe latter s inability under law to pay backup charges at morethan twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plantswould have been exposed long ago.But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justifyeven greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, theEnron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As aserious, responsible government that knows the importance ofhonouring one s word in a world where contract is king, theVajpayee Government must honour the country s contractualobligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying toalter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did notsee, but by definition all future changes must be by mutualconsent.The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol s poweraffordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committeeand the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buythe $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into aseparate company that can supply gas to all the current andfuture users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one betterand bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and managethe plant. This is entirely feasible because its installedcapacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. Thiswill bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges andcost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of theequity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreignexchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicingrepresents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairmanof BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupeedebt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricitytariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oilhaving fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changeswill bring down the cost of Dabhol s power at 90 per centcapacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will makeit entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and theneighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in theaverage power tariff or are able to bring down power theft andreduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.The right course for the centre even at this late stage will beto take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it withEnron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from itat cost and make the above structural changes on its own beforehanding it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court willneither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol s power nor answerthe more basic question - how can any electricity grid add newpower plants to itself without raising the average tariff itcharges for electricity.Copyrights: 1995 - 2001 The HinduRepublication or redissemination of the contents of this screen are expresslyprohibited without the consent of The Hindu</data>

      <data key="e_body"> -----Original Message-----From: 	&quot;Bransgrove. Alan&quot; &lt;Alan.Bransgrove@xemkt.com&gt;@ENRON  Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 3:55 PMTo:	Nemec, GeraldCc:	Dolan, SueSubject:	ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreements with PSCo and CLF&amp;PGerald,At long last I have been able to get input from others within our companysuch that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referencedAgreements for Public Service Company of Colorado (&quot;PSCo&quot;) and CheyenneLight, Fuel and Power (&quot;CLF&amp;P&quot;).  I apologize for the delay.  Our commentsare as follows:Public Service Company of Colorado AgreementDisparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of ourcompanies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;.  Weneed to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files forregulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit thatthe confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signedand returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21Transactions.3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments inthe normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to andfrom a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCoor CLF&amp;P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we proposethat the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between theparties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limitedto be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a TriggeringEvent and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under theAgreement.4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established fortermination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to seethe language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may&quot;establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.&quot;4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don t understand theinclusion of the phrase &quot;or deemed to be repeated&quot;.  Unless I am missingsomething, it doesn t make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Pleasedelete this phrase in the Agreement.4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout theAgreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made toAffiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the accountstatus of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&amp;P isauthorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&amp;P in therespective Agreements.Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical ofmost Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeurefor the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on theability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language inyour draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one timeonly, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure nolonger applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In otherwords, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrenceinvolving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standardForce Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.Section 8.1. Notices.

      <data key="e_body">Jason,  To follow up on our discussion last week, Enron Compression Service=s Company (not a debtor, and owned 100% by ENA) is receiving physical gas u=nder its Compression Services Agreements with Transwestern Pipeline Company=.  The gas is delivered to ECS on TW s system as consideration for ECS deli=very of electric compression services.  This gas was sold by ECS to ENA und=er a long term Master Firm, but obviously that has blown up.  TW has been d=esperate to get this gas off of their system since it is packing their pipe=line worse every day.  We put into place a GISB with Richardson Energy Mark=eting, Ltd.  I made sure there was not cross affiliate netting language in =the GISB.  Some of the gas was sold over the Christmas weekend (about 20,00=0 per day) and more is being sold this week.  We need to put into place a l=ong term sale for the remainder of the term of the compression deals (appro=ximately 7 years) to protect the compression services deals.  Sid may be a =potential counterparty, but it may be sold to someone else.  Please provide= any input you may have on how we need to structure this sale given the cur=rent situation.</data>

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).

Alan [mailto:Alan.Bransgrove@xemkt.com]Sent: Friday, November 09, 2001 9:34 AMTo: Tucker, PatrickCc: Carter, Tim; Ishee, JeffSubject: ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement with NorthernStates Power CompanyPatrick:At long last I have been able to get input from others within our companysuch that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referencedAgreement for Northern States Power Company (&quot;NSP&quot;).  I apologize for thedelay.  Our comments are as follows:Northern States Power Company AgreementDisparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of ourcompanies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.    2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;.  Weneed to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files forregulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit thatthe confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signedand returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21Transactions.    3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments inthe normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to andfrom a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSPacts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose thatthe provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties bedeleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to beapplicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event andthe calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.    4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established fortermination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to seethe language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may&quot;establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.&quot;4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don t understand theinclusion of the phrase &quot;or deemed to be repeated&quot;.  Unless I am missingsomething, it doesn t make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Pleasedelete this phrase in the Agreement.     4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout theAgreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made toAffiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the accountstatus of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized tocontractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please deleteall references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.  Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical ofmost Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeurefor the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on theability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language inyour draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one timeonly, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure nolonger applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In otherwords, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrenceinvolving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standardForce Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, pleaseinsert &quot;provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically&quot;.Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised tothe more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)of the other Party, &quot;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&quot;.Please modify this provision accordingly.  Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with thisprovision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties ofmerchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchasedunder the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for theordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Sectionaccordingly.  Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISBStandard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 dayconfirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  Werequest that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industrystandard. Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expandedbeyond a review of the level of each company s credit rating.  Pleasereplace your definition with the following:  	&quot;Material Adverse Change&quot; with respect to a Party means (i) anydowngrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	orany entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of creditsupport for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a&quot;Credit Support Provider&quot; for such Party) such that such debt israted below &quot;BBB-&quot; or its equivalent by Standard &amp; Poors or below&quot;Baa3&quot;, or its equivalent, by Moody s Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	anyunsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &amp;Poors or Moody s Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material AdverseChange shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in thereasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a materialadverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, orability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, toperform its obligations in connection 	herewith.   Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in generalagreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seemspreferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost ofcover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 dayaverage of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.Please modify your definition accordingly.  Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreementconsistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questionsor wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me viareturn e-mail or at the phone number listed below.     Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you tofinalize this Agreement.</data>

Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a &quot;material adverse impact on Enron s ability to continue as a going concern,&quot; it warned.

To:     Sales Trading                    11/21/01 07:42       cc:                    AM                   Subject:     DYN($42/sh)/ENE($7/sh) Merger At                                          Risk.SUMMARY:  We are reducing our estimated probability that the DYN/ENE mergeris completed to less than 50%/50% based on our belief that ENE s existingwholesale and retail businesses are having a difficult time maintainingtheir volumes and margins.  We have discussed ENE s need to improve counterparty confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and webelieve counter party confidence deteriorated further based on theinformation included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in thestock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions withcompeting traders and marketers (representative of ENE s counterparties--which are critical in maintaining ENE s volumes) is becoming morenegative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improvingsince the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggestingimproment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE s liquidityposition seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recentcapital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volumeand margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8Kdisclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committedto provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the toneof the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing tradingactivities with ENE.OPINION ON THE STOCKS:   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply   not worth the downside risk.   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE s talent away   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to   terminate the transaction through material adverse change   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still   has $5/sh to $7/sh of &quot;deal&quot; premium factored into the current stock   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN s trading agreement with   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).COUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transactionvolume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  Ifyou are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-termtransaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with othersuppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create theaccount receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically whywould you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to theultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believethat ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchasesand/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.However, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.EPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES s   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.*****************************************************************************************************This e-mail is based on information obtained from sources which Simmons &amp;Company International believes to be reliable, but Simmons &amp; CompanyInternational does not represent or warrant its accuracy.

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

He joined the Mujahidin.  A= shell hit his post on the Samali Plain in 1999. It killed four of his comr=ades. Karimullah escaped to a Pashtun village whose inhabitants handed him =over to the Taleban. Tried by a &quot;military tribunal&quot; in Kabul, after torture= he was sent to the city s Pulecharkhi jail for having served with the Alli=ance.  &quot;I had been there 12 weeks when three Talebs came into my cell,&quot; he =said. &quot;They called my name out and said I was to be released.&quot; Baffled but =relieved, Karimullah was led to a Datsun pick-up.  &quot;They began driving me t=o the Ghazi stadium,&quot; Karimullah said. &quot;I was silent at the beginning, but =as we neared it I asked,  What is this? What of my release?  They told me, = Wait you will be released .&quot;  The Datsun drove into the centre of the stad=ium. Karimullah recalls thousands of faces staring at him in silence from t=he stands, and between 10 and 14 mullahs on chairs in a line in the middle =of the field. He was pulled from the truck and told to lie spreadeagled on =the grass.  &quot;The mullahs didn t even ask my name or speak to the crowd. Sev=en doctors approached me. They wore grey uniforms, surgical masks and glove=s. I could see one was crying. They injected me. After five minutes my body= was numb though I was still conscious. Then they put clamps on my hand and= foot and began to cut them off with special saws. There was no pain but I =could see what they were doing.&quot;  I asked him if he stared at the sky. He t=old me he was transfixed by the sight of his foot being removed.  &quot;There wa=s a sigh and murmur from the crowd when they finished. It had taken about f=ive minutes. Taleban guards threw me into the back of the pick-up. One was =crying too. Nothing was said. Even now I am unaware why I was chosen for am=putation&quot;.  He was taken to Kabul s Wazir Akbar Khan hospital. After a week= eight of his former prison guards visited him. They brought him apples and= 600,000 afghanis (?10).  &quot;They apologised. They told me they had not known= what would happen. I threw the money and apples back at them. I screamed t=hat they had told me I would be released and instead had taken my foot and =hand for nothing. They left.&quot;  On the tenth day he was discharged. A taxi t=ook him to his parents  home. They had no idea what had happened to him.  K=arimullah s eight-year-old sister, Razia, answered the taxi-driver s knock =on the door. She burst into tears when she saw her brother sprawled in the =back of the cab. Worse was to follow. &quot;My mother had been ill for some time= so was very weak. When she saw me, she collapsed. She regained consciousne=ss for a few hours, but then had a heart attack and died.  &quot;I thought the w=orst day of my life had been in the stadium. Coming home was worse. Her nam=e was Masherin. She was 42.&quot;  He became a beggar, his mutilation carrying w=ith it the stigma and shame of the punishment normally meted out to a thief=.  Then, a few weeks ago, a cousin, a Mujahidin commander, got a message th=rough the lines offering him help. Borrowing a spare prosthetic leg from a =mine victim in Kabul, Karimullah limped northwards for days, crossing the f=ront with other refugees.The Red Cross is preparing a prosthetic leg for hi=m, but some scars cannot be repaired.  &quot;I am finished. I have no future,&quot; K=arimullah said. &quot;I have had everything taken from me by the Taleban. Before= they came to Kabul I was a student in the tenth grade, an educated man wit=h some chances before me.  &quot;Someone told me a rich Pashtun had committed a =crime and paid the corrupt mullahs to use a prisoner of war for public ampu=tation instead of himself. I don t know if it s true. But I hate them.  &quot;I =dream only of having my hand again so I could carry a gun and go to the fro=nt line and kill and kill. I d kill them all, every Taleb and every mullah.=&quot;=09=09&lt;!--A.copyright:link {color:#000000;}A.copyright:visited {color:#000000;}A.copyright:hover {color:#999999;}// --&gt;=09Copyright 2001 Times Newspapers Ltd &lt;/section/0,,97,00.html&gt;.

      <data key="e_body">Larry:Hope all is ok with your current situation.  I hope you know you can take a=ny time off necessary to deal with the matter. =20=20Congrats on the great deal Monday and I appreciate the heads up before tran=sacting that size deal.=20I m sorry you missed the mtg monday afternoon.  I want to sum up what my th=oughts are and what I ve learned over the past couple days.  First of all, =I m very disappointed in some of the current but mostly former employees of= this company.  I think we, in gas trading, have made great efforts to crea=te a very strong and profitable franchise without ever compromising our int=egrity.=20While I do not believe any fraud nor illegal activity has occurred, I do be=lieve Enron pushed the gray area more than was necessary in some of these d=ealings.  And while I don t believe Fastow acted unethically or inappropria=tely in these dealings (and I may be wrong), I do think the presence of a c=onflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety should have precluded= him from these entering into these transactions.  There is a reason why En=ron employees are not allowed to trade energy commodities for their own acc=ount.  It is not because Enron does not trust its employees to do the right= thing; it is an effort to prevent even the slightest allegation that an em=ployee s first and foremost responsibility is not to the company.  That is =where, in my opinion, Fastow errored. =20I think employee morale has been damaged for 3 reasons over the past year. = First, we are tired of bad business deals: India, South American assets, A=zurix, broadband, etc.  Second, over this period of poor business judgment,= some of the same individuals who made these decisions were very well compe=nsated.  Third, I think there is a concern about the integrity of the organ=ization and the top managers.  Rather than worry about the past, I prefer t=o look at the organization going forward.  The truth about the LJM matter w=ill be brought forward through one or more of the following : legal courtro=om, SEC investigation, internal Enron investigation, court of public opinio=n, court of Enron employees  opinion, and investigative journalism.  If any= officers of the company acted inappropriately at any time, I can almost gu=arantee they will not have a future at this company.  I say that because I =do believe in the current management.  The question you, as well as other e=mployees need to be asking themselves, is twofold.  First, will the current= problems affect the organization s abililty to conduct business in the fut=ure?  And second, has the culture of the organization changed over the past= several years whereby these probems will not happen again?   As long as we= can maintain our credit rating, which I believe we can, I believe this wil=l have minimal effect to the trading business and little effect on Enron s =business.  Our desire to conserve capital at this point to shore up the bal=ance sheet means we won t be buying any hundred million dollar+ assets in t=he near future, which is probably a good thing.  The second question is jus=t as important.  I will tell you honestly that had the management of this c=ompany of 2 years ago be in place today, I would not currently be an employ=ee here.  Over the past couple years, the management turnover has been extr=emely beneficial.  Gone are  Pai, Hannon, Rice, Skilling, Sutton, etc. that= had, with the exception of Skilling, limited intellectual ability, integri=ty, and drive.  The new management of Whalley, Lavorato, Sheriff, Fallon, a=nd Delainey, in my opinion, is one of the most capable management teams in =business today.  These are people that will make the right business decisio=ns and are not afraid to act as individuals.  I do believe in this team and=, so long Enron treats the trading organization well at the end of the year= which I have no reason to believe otherwise, intend to continue our missio=n to create the most dominant energy trading franchise around. =20We all want to yell at someone for the debacle that has been created.  Unfo=rtunatley, most of those people arent at the company anymore.  I do encoura=ge you to go to the employee mtg tomorrow regardless of market conditions. = Enron values and needs your contributions, and thus it is important to me =that you are comfortable with the organization going forward.  I think it i=s benficial to hear Enron s side of the story as well as what we read in th=e paper. =20John</data>

RESOURCESCheck stock quotes. Enter ticker for Enron: ENE Enter ticker for Dynegy: DYN     Fractions DecimalsThose business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company s poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant s reputation and value in the past month. &quot;In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,&quot; Lay said. &quot;The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence.&quot; To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company s bottom line any time soon &quot;These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we ll need to look at each carefully,&quot; he said. The company s central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year s end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that s due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin s debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. &quot;Everything we know, you now know,&quot; Lay told the analysts. Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn t provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that s due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin s debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. &quot;Everything we know, you now know,&quot; Lay told the analysts. Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn t provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

RESOURCESCheck stock quotes. Enter ticker for Enron: ENE Enter ticker for Dynegy: DYN     Fractions DecimalsThose business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company s poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant s reputation and value in the past month. &quot;In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,&quot; Lay said. &quot;The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence.&quot; To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company s bottom line any time soon &quot;These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we ll need to look at each carefully,&quot; he said. The company s central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year s end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that s due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin s debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron. Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders  equity for Enron.

He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.

EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/25/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major= energy-trading companies.=20Investors appeared worried that Enron s recent woes could have a destabiliz=ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation s t=raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=actions.&quot;Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,&quot; said Merrill Lynch an=alyst Donato Eassey. &quot;There s not a trader out there that doesn t use Enron=Online.&quot; As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =which the company s credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=old head of the company s industrial-markets division. His selection may be= intended, in part, to raise the company s credibility. People familiar wit=h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow s role in running two limi=ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face= of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street= analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=ctions.=20While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as= the company s dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=gements clearly played a role in the executive s departure. &quot;In my continue=d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,&quot; said Ch=airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20Enron said Mr. Fastow &quot;will be on a leave of absence from the company.&quot; He =couldn t be reached for comment.=20It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow s removal will assuage an increas=ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market= close and followed a day in which Enron s stock once again plunged. As of =4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board s most active list at ne=arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =stock.=20Enron s shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,= which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=h different than Enron s, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=ed investment vehicles.=20Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow s departure could= be seen as evidence that &quot;management does care&quot; about investor concerns. H=owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as &quot;an admissi=on of guilt.&quot; Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=gely because of uncertainties about the company s extremely complex financi=al structure.=20Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=.=20Worries and rumors about Enron s financial strength could be found in the s=tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =people voice concerns about a possible &quot;death spiral&quot; in which increasing c=redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn t yet seen any eviden=ce of such a problem.=20However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about= its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=ntities. Enron is facing a problem with &quot;trust and credibility. It s not ea=sy to regain something as basic as trust,&quot; he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Looks at DealingsBy FLOYD NORRIS10/25/2001The New York TimesPage 2, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20  In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear= to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =as C.F.O.,   Kenneth L. Lay, Enron s chairman and chief executive, said in =a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board   continue to have= the highest faith and confidence in Andy.  The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron s industrial market=s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.==20The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=ere Enron s shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion= reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion= write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=en they later learned about it.=20On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the= transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.= Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=ls of the transactions.=20The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron s= disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=.=20By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity= that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=o address.=20Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from= complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=d investors that the company   expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=dity to meet normal obligations,   and said it had bank credit lines that w=ere more than adequate.=20Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow s= successor, was Enron s treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=g, they fell to $16.14.=20One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol= Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to   sell  = from   hold.   She had lowered the rating to   hold   from   buy   on Mond=ay.=20  After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,   she said in an interview yester=day evening,   Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as= a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a= little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.  ==20But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way.   People cou=ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you ll never ge=t any answers.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

The com=pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=one anything improper.=20&quot;In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=s CFO,&quot; Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=, found itself high on Wall Street s hit list after it released third-quart=er earnings on Oct 16.=20The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=n s board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and= LJM2 Co-Investment.=20The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,= served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =Enron s shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2= billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected= in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a &quot;Chinese wall&quot; existed be=tween Enron and LJM.=20Fastow s replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron s treasurer befor=e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=he company s industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon= asked to be reassigned from the treasurer s job because he was uncomfortab=le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=or comment Wednesday. He also didn t know whether Fastow is still receiving= a salary.=20Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an &quot;=informal inquiry&quot; into the LJM dealings.=20The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=ling in August for personal reasons.=20A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron s various fina=ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give= analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=es.=20Investors wouldn t like that because it would dilute the value of current o=utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron s debt credit rating may= be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.==20In the last six days, Enron s shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=.=20Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron s woes could in some= way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn t go as Enron hoped.=20On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=, moved from a &quot;hold&quot; to a &quot;sell&quot; rating.=20FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief.By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY.10/25/2001Financial Times (U.K. edition)(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.Kenneth Lay, Enron s chief executive officer, said after the market closed =that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October= 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the= partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=change Commission.=20&quot;In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=s CFO,&quot; Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =Enron s industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow.

As details of this dea=l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that= once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=astow is taking a leave of absence. He s been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =formerly CEO of Enron s industrial markets group.=20How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon s a=lleged opposition to Fastow s role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to= show that the &quot;Fastow era&quot; is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained= about Fastow s possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =Fastow couldn t serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that s a positive for Enro=n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal s accoun=t of McMahon s stance on LJM2 was correct.=20Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow s departure shows that it too=k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a= difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=ing. It took Wednesday s plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=he company?=20The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and= Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow s replacement was nec=essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company s core energy trading bu=siness makes money. It s hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge= that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had= not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market s views. =Arguably, that s downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent= on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they re unavoidable. The =spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=arency.=20Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20Phew!

Pipeline subsidiary `A-` ratedsenior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. andTranswestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating WatchNegative.The rating action primarily relates to the negative capitalmarket reaction to recent disclosures by the company. Theloss of investor and counterparty confidence, if itcontinues, would impair Enron s financial flexibility andaccess to capital markets, therefore, impacting its abilityto conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announceda $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken inthe third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheetequity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding ofstructured transactions. Since that time, there have beenseveral damaging news reports on the company and itsmanagement. More importantly, investors have voicedconcerns. Enron s common stock price has plummeted andspreads on its debt have widened.The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publiclystated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct itsbusiness. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity isavailable under committed bank lines.An additional concern is that certain structuredtransactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust IIand Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repaymentexist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlyingassets, or an equity offering, primary credit support isderived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorilyconvertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient torepay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120days prior to the maturity date or upon a note triggerevent. In the event that the issuance of the preferredstock yields less than the amount required to redeem thesenior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliveradditional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver onits obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes apayment obligation of Enron, representing a generalunsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgradeof Enron s senior unsecured debt below investment grade byone of the major rating agencies in conjunction withspecified declines in Enron s closing stock price overthree consecutive trading days, Enron would have aforebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt wasbeing made to register the shares. The total amount ofMarlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enronhas not verified that the underlying assets have adequatemarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitchhas no information to indicate that there are anyfundamental problems with Enron s core wholesale, retail,and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contactwith the company on a continuing basis to both monitorongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow10/25/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&amp;P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. &quot;In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,&quot; said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron s Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow s role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to &quot;buy- speculative,&quot; from &quot;buy-high risk&quot;, to reflect his concerns that &quot;lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron s commercial operations.&quot; &quot;This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,&quot; he said. ng/lj For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

(ENE), but they have made almost no changes inpolicies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, thecompanies said Thursday.   The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter ofthe trade in the country s power and gas markets, has seen its share price fallby a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financialstructure.   Moody s has put Enron s credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some ofthe company s debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market thisweek.   &quot;We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,&quot; said JohnSousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). &quot;It s business as usual.&quot;   Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has madeno changes and has no concerns about Enron s credit. Another Top 10 power andgas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.   Other companies expressed concern, though they ve taken little if any action.  &quot;Like everyone else in the marketplace, we re proceeding with caution,&quot; saidLora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the NorthAmerican subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A.   Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn texpect to make any drastic changes.  Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power RevenuesBy Andrew DowellOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/25/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state s wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state s ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. &quot;It s that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,&quot; Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state s role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren t creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn t envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. Willing To Renegotiate Separately, Williams  officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. &quot;We re always willing to sit down with a customer,&quot; Malcolm said. Williams hasn t been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. &quot;To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,&quot; he said. Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron s proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. &quot;That s interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,&quot; Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country s power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. &quot;We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,&quot; Malcolm said. TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp. s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News10/25/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank s decision to leave interest rates unchanged.About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard &amp; Poor s 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. Prior to release of the economic news, S&amp;P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. In addition to pouring over Thursday s economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation s top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant s Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London s Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt s DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan s Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. In Wednesday s session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government s economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&amp;T, which issued weak outlooks. In major U.S. market action Wednesday: Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. The dollar was mixed.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased EnronCorp. Common StockNEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. andcertain of the Company s officers and directors in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit isbrought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the commonstock of Enron Corporation (&quot;Enron&quot;) (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the &quot;Class Period&quot;).The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers anddirectors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendantsengaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliatesand interested parties, which disguised Enron s true financialposition.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden fromthe public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improveEnron s balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at anartificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who heldpositions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts ofinterest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from thesetransactions.The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendantsmade misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron sBroadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron s shareprice.  With knowledge that Enron s Broadband business would neverpost a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued tomake misleading statements about the Broadband business in order tomaintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron s Broadbandbusiness to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars infinancing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financingarrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron s earnings,its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron sfinances from its investors and the market, further artificiallyinflating Enron s share price.  While the stock was artificiallyinflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensiveinsider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482million during the Class Period, before the public became aware ofthe above practices.Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and isrepresented by Kaplan Fox &amp; Kilsheimer LLP.

Joe Kernen, co-anchor:              We ve got to shift gears into this Enron situation which              has just been--you ve been talking about it quite a bit,              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred              million in revenues.              James Cramer, guest market commentator:              Maybe.              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize              the whole energy trading arena and...              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you re thinking!  No              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the              California utility system and profited from it.  That s my              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there              we re going to discover this.              Kernen:  Let s see what happened...              Haines:  Now, wait a second...              David Faber, co-anchor:              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is              that new?  Is that something--              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,              something...              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?              Cramer:  Well, no, I m actually being a little forward              thinking.              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited              partnership transactions of Mr.--              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking              about.              Cramer:  No, I m saying that this is what, if I were an              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly              what was happening with the electricity market which then              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?              Kernen:  Well, let s talk about the actual news.  Here s              yesterday s trading--              Haines:  Wait a minute.              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.              That s the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that              Fastow, after four--              Faber:  Late yesterday.              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o clock, Fastow is gone.  What s              interesting--              Faber:  He s the CFO--              Kernen:  But he s a new CFO.              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these              off balance sheet partnerships.              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I m not on thin ice here, I m not              on thin ice.              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this              is your theory.              Cramer:  This is my theory.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I              think we ve got to find out more about that short squeeze              that occurred.              Haines:  OK.              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now              he s back as CFO and we ll whether that calms the market              down.              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and              those who ve left the company as investors over this last              week have wanted.  Let s see everything; be as transparent              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their              investors, they need to come clean with their trading              counterparties because that is really what people are              concerned about.              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go              down, how would that affect energy trading?              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they re going to be              there on the other side and make good on the trades.              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn t you?              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren t, but why would you--if              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.              Kernen:  Now, why would--              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?              Because of something that could unravel--              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities              they may have--              Kernen:  That they don t know about at this point.              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?              They don t know.  But that s one of the reasons--              Kernen:  We re talking hundreds of millions or billions?              Faber:  They don t know.              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited              partners?              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is              what some analysts estimated.              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets              that they have in the partnerships themselves.              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what s happened              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if              we went back a year, you d see eighty as far as the high              for Enron.  Now we re at sixteen.              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got              hurt.              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don t--  Here we go.              Faber:  I m sorry.  I m getting a little excited.              Kernen:  You are.              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.              Kernen:  There s a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know              what s coming next, don t you?  Now I m worried about the              utility average.  I ve worried about the transportation              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have              replaced my worries.  I m angst-ridden.  Did you see this              chart?  We re breaking below the--              Cramer:  That s a positive, not a negative, Joe.              Kernen:  What s wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?              Cramer:  I m all fired up!              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he s got the DOJ getting              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you              going down to Houston yourself?              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that              whole city.              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that s the--now getting down              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are              retesting those.  That s not something to worry about?              Cramer:  No, because I think there s a lot of money going              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn t say the              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much              stronger than before.              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I              don t--we re talking about four hundred to two-ninety at              this point.  That s a long way.              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but              I still think that--              Kernen:  It s no longer the--              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don t want safety              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.                        # # #</data>

      <data key="e_body">In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis  hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.Davis  proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis  proposed rate agreement.What is Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis  proposal?With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California s General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.Safe to say that today s PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to &quot;solving&quot; California electricity crisis in shambles.What Next?A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.The bill would create a &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis  hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.Davis  proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis  proposed rate agreement.What is Davis  proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis  proposal?With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California s General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.Safe to say that today s PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to &quot;solving&quot; California electricity crisis in shambles.What Next?A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.The bill would create a &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the &quot;dedicated rate component&quot; is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.Given today s vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.Update on Edison BailoutStill appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another &quot;special&quot; session next Tuesday.If you have any questions, just let us know.Best,Jeff</data>

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission s decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message-----From: 	Dasovich, Jeff  Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PMTo:	Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?

      <data key="e_subject">PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison</data>
      <data key="e_body">PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising ratesThe California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers  costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison s annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison s shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.&quot;This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,&quot; said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  &quot;The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers.&quot;This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.

      <data key="e_body"> -----Original Message-----From: 	Tucker, Patrick  Sent:	Wednesday, November 14, 2001 11:44 AMTo:	Pollan, Sylvia S.; Culotta, Lindsay; Murrell, Russell E; Plachy, Denver; Cuilla, Martin; Storey, Geoff; Yawapongsiri, Virawan; Mahmassani, Souad; Donohoe, Tom; Ruscitti, Kevin; Shively, Hunter S.; Lewis, Andrew H.; Giron, Darron C.; Frihart, Bryant; Roberts, Linda; Luce, Laura; Hogan, Irena D.; Vickers, Frank; Williams, Jason (Trading); Mims, Patrice L.; Simpson, James; Hodge, John; Keavey, Peter F.; Mckay, Brad; Mckay, Jonathan; Pereira, Susan W.; Pimenov, Vladi; Ring, Andrea; Savvas, Leonidas; Townsend, Judy; Versen, Victoria; Barbe, Robin; Concannon, Ruth; Goodell, Scott; Jones, David; Kaiser, Jared; Loving, Scott; Bates, Kimberly; Muhl, Gil; Smith, Maureen; Smith, Shauywn; Taylor, Craig; Willis, Jim; Tucker, Patrick; McCaffrey, Deirdre; Penman, Gregg; Kinsey, Lisa; Brady, Kevin; Pendergrass, CoraSubject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14Here are my notes from today s call.  As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you d like more color.Patrick Tucker</data>

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

As with Monday, I ve focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.Enron s business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelinesNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced  dismal  returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&amp;P assets.  Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be  inefficient , McMahon says.Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix  assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the  Enron topup  obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  Osprey contains energy-related assets and  other assets .  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with  large financial institutions .  The underlying transactions are already on Enron s balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&amp;T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working  virtually 7 days a week .  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.McMahon says it s  way too early to tell  if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  Broadband is expected to be fully wound up  sometime over the course of the next year .  (Did not catch this part clearly).  The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  $1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of  crude oil and gas .  The transactions relate to the  physical movement  of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be  a couple of weeks  before we re able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  McMahon:  There hasn t been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But  we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows. Whalley says that we re hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.McMahon:  &quot;The company is overlevered; that s a fact.&quot;--hence our pursuit of additional equity.McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.

      <data key="e_body">Kim, Kelli and Jeff -I have taken a look at the Northern California Power Agency deal, and it looks pretty good from a credit standpoint.  We currently have some exposure to NCPA on the power side, but it rolls off by the end of the year, so I think that we can still get this deal done.  Some outstanding issues:1.  We MUST have a Master Firm in place with NCPA to transact on this deal.  I can begin working on this, but I need to get NCPA s latest financial results to determine an appropriate collateral threshold for NCPA.  This shouldn t be a huge hurdle.2.  We need to ask Jeff Hodge for his opinion with respect to NCPA transacting a deal of this tenor.  There are sometimes tenor limits placed on municipal entities to limit the term under which they are authorized to transact.  Jeff:  How do we research this issue?  NCPA has provided us a brief statement that indicates that &quot;NCPA will work expeditiously to execute a definitive contract and has all the necessary approval authorities&quot;, but my feeling is that we need something a little more substantial than that.3.  Kelli:  Have you spoken with Global Finance to price the embedded loan in this deal?4.  Kim:  I don t think a credit reserve will be needed on this deal.5.  Kim:  From the document that NCPA sent out, it appears that your Monday bid is preliminary and conditional.  We need to make sure that NCPA understands our requirements with respect to executing a Master.  Can your contact at NCPA help me get a copy of their latest financials so we can expedite that process?6.  Kim:  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  NCPA s credit ratings have remained solid throughout the California power crisis, for a number of reasons.  As such, I am pretty comfortable moving forward with this deal, given the above requirements.  However, if their financial results indicate some problems, we may need to include some stringent credit requirements in the Master.  I m pretty sure that their results will look good, but this is a contingency to bear in mind as your prepare your bid.Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks,JRW</data>

Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they re simply in chronological order.The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  Specific points:EES will be a part of the new company.  Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for  very little  additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE  has sufficient liquidity , ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  Debt/equity of combined company expected to be &lt;45%.Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  In what was termed a &quot;new approach&quot;, the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron &lt;$50MM.  Lay says that Enron had other options,  particularly financial .All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be  pretty big , but that the companies feel they re able to appropriately value this exposure.Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.Dynegy says that  several  internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there s absolutely nothing else out there.Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had  close to a billion  in cash.  Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that  our backs are not against the wall , and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.McMahon says  no comment  to WSJ article indicating that ENE s banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won t be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.Watson says that the  creative financing  surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that,  frankly , DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by  Enron s top three executives , who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy s deliberations on proceeding with the merger.Watson/Doty said that they re NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron s books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron s assets or businesses.  Dynegy s lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a  blunt instrument  under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron s total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.McMahon adds that there  could  be more restatements, but he  does not expect  there to be more restatements.ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.Initial reaction of ratings agencies  very positive  to combined entities.  McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.Dynegy s earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a  25% haircut  to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy s books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a  very very substantial  portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.ChevronTexaco s investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco s investment is now at a  more substantial  discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get  different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better .  (No further clarification given).Whalley believes that  we ll retain  the Enron traders and marketers. They re used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are  very excited  by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that  to the extent necessary, yes. Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he s a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.Give me a call if you d like me to try to clarify any of these comments.Patrick Tuckerx3-3055</data>

We can recap for you at end of day, if you would like.  We chose counterparties that execute energy derivative transactions via EOL who have debt ratings that are higher than those of Enron. We can give you a complete recap at end of day.  Bill Bradford in Credit would be the likely party to be fielding questions from counterparties on credit questions.

I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants.

I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig?

I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him. Weare all going todie tonight.12:59 We have finished three-quartersof the bottleof Glenlivet. We decide it would be awonderful ideato go dancing at PollyEsther s. Ed hasto pee. Hewalks down the hall to our apartmentand directly intothe full length mirror at the end ofthe hall,smashing it into hundreds of pieces. Wegiggleuncontrollably and leave forPollyEsther s.1:17 The PollyEsther s doorman laughsuncontrollablyat our efforts to enter his club.&quot;Fellas,&quot; he saysin between his fits of spasticlaughter, &quot;I ve beenworking this door for almost a year.I ve beenworkingdoors in this town for almost 5 years.And I canhonestly say that I ain t never seenthree drunkermother fuckers than you three.Sorry, can t let youin.&quot; We attempt to reason with him.

Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him.

Nota single cloud in the sky. About 70degrees.11:55 I decide that we re going to kickthe shit outof Nebraska.11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan togo fuckhimself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the wayto theAlamodome. We re on the second floor ofa two-storyparking garage on the corner (a couplehundred of us).We re hooting and hollering likewildmen. The banddoubles back to the street right belowus andserenades us with Texas Fight and TheEyes of Texas.AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,50-100 grownmen are bumping chests with oneanother, each andevery one of them now secure andcertain of the factthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska.1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on theway to theAlamodome. Again, we hoot and hollerlike wildmen.Again, the band doubles back and stopsright below usto serenade us, this time, however,with the Nebraskafight songs. Although somewhatimpressed by theirspirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we aregoing to kick the shit out ofNebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,somehowmanaging to stuff the &quot;Traveler&quot; and 11cans of beerinto my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded byNebraska fans. Theyare taunting me. I am taunting back,still certainthat we are going to kick theshit out of Nebraska. Idecide to challenge a particularlyvocal Nebraska fanto play what I now call and willforever be rememberedas &quot;Cell-Phone Flop Out.&quot; Remember flopout for adollar? The rules are similar. I tellthis Nebraskajackass that if he s so confident inhis team, heshould &quot;flop out&quot; his cell phone RIGHTNOW and makeplane reservations to Phoenix for theFiesta Bowl.And then I spoke these memorable words:&quot;And notthosedamn refundable tickets, either! Yourequest thosenon-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!&quot;He backs down. He is unworthy. I callSouthwestAirlines and buy two tickets toPhoenix,non-refundableand non-transferrable. Price: $712. Heis humbled.He lowers his head in shame. I raise mycell phone intriumph to the cheers of hundreds ofTexas fans. I amKING and these are my subjects. Idistribute the 11beers in my pants to the cheeringmasses. I RULE thepre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,I open theTraveler and pour my first stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling:Nebraska is big.Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is verypissed off atTexas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.9 yardstotal offense for Texas. Zero firstdowns for Texas.I m still talking shit. I pouranother stiffy fromthe Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the firsthalf: theTraveler is a dead soldier. I buy myfirst $5 beerfrom the Alamodome merchants. While Iam standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitatesMajorApplewhiteand rolls out of the end zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas0. I wish Ihad another Traveler.4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraskafan in thebathroom at halftime, I attempt torevive the classicBrice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:&quot;Hey, buddy,niiiiiiiiice cock.&quot; He isunamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer fromthe Alamodomemerchants. I share my beer with twohigh school girlssitting behind me. Surprisingly, theyare equippedwith a flask full of vodka. I send themoff topurchase $5 Sprites, so that we mayconsume theirvodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraskais a bunch ofpussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sittingbehind me havefled for their lives. I purchase twomore $5 beersfrom the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. Iam beginningto lose faith. This normally wouldtrouble me, but Iam too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: &quot;I msorry, sir.Those tickets have been confirmed andarenon-refundable and non-transferrable.&quot;5:37 I try to start a fight with everyperson behindthe concession counter. As it turnsout, theAlamodome has a policy that no beer canbe sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on thegame clock. I amenraged by this policy. I ask loudly:&quot;Why the fuckdidn t you announce last call over thefucking PAsystem??!!&quot;5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped inmy chair indefeat. All of a sudden, the Texascrowd goesabsolutely nuts. &quot;Whazzis?,&quot; I mutter,awaking frommy coma, &quot;Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store.

Did wez scort?&quot;Alas, theanswer is no, we were not winning andwe did notscore.The largest (by far) cheer of the dayfrom the Texasfaithful occurred when the handlerswere walking backto the tunnel and Bevo stopped to takea gargantuanshit all over the letters &quot;S&quot;,&quot;K&quot;, and &quot;A&quot; in the&quot;Nebraska&quot; spelled out in their endzone. I cheerwildly. I pick up the empty Travelerbottle and stickmy tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk asI walk backto the truck. I would taunt them withsome off-colorremarks about their parentage, but I amtoo drunk toform complete sentences. With my lastcognitivethought of the evening, I take solacein the fact thatif we had not beaten them in October,they would beplaying Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way backto Austin forthe 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We canstill salvagethe day! I crack open a beer. It iswarm. I don tcare.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I amhungry. I goinside the store. I walk past the beerfrig. Inotice a Zima. I ve never had a Zima. Iwonder ifit s any good. I pull a Zima from thefrig. I twistthe top off and drink the Zima in threeswallows.Zimasucks. I replace the empty bottle inthe frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in thestore. I walk towhere the ingredients are, where theperson usuallymakes the sub. There is no one there. Ilean overthe counter and scoop out half a bucketof blackolives. I eat them. I am still hungry.I leanfurther over the counter and grabapproximately twopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of thestoregrunting and eating Pastrami. Thepatrons in thestore fear me. I don t care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I havebeen drinkingwarm beer and singing Brooks and Dunntunes for overan hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. Hesuggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunnhave writtenother good songs besides &quot;You re Goingto Miss Me WhenI m Gone&quot; and &quot;Neon Moon&quot; and thatmaybe listening toonly those two songs, ten times eachwas a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, Icould just let theCD play on its own. I tell him tofuck off andrestart &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. Mytruckmate,against my loud and profaneprotestations, parks onthe top floor of a nearby parkinggarage. I tell himhe s an idiot. I tell him we will neverget out. Itell him we may as well pitch afucking tent here. Heignores me. I think he s still pissedabout theBrooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle &quot;NeonMoon&quot; loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beersstuffed inmy pants. We re going to kick theshit out ofArizona.9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona29. I ampleased. I go to the bathroom to peefor the 67thtime today. I giggle to myself becauseof thenew opportunity to do &quot;the bathroomBrice.&quot; There areno Arizona fans in the bathroom. I amdisappointed.I tell myself (out loud) that I have a&quot;Niiiiiicecock.&quot; No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom whiledrinking Bud Lightout of a can. Needless to say, they donot sell beerat the Erwin Center, much less BudLight out of a can.I am stopped by an usher: &quot;Where didyou getthat, sir?&quot; I tell him (no shit):&quot;Oh, thecheerleaders were throwing them up withthose littleplastic footballs. Would you mindthrowing this awayfor me?&quot; I take the last swig and handit to him. Heis confused. I pretend I m going to thebathroom, butI run away giggling instead. I duckinto someentrance to avoid the usher, who is nowpursuing me.I sneak into a large group of peopleand sit down.Theusher walks by harmlessly. I amgiggling like a littlegirl. I crack open another can of BudLight.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoidthe usher, Ihave lost my bearings. I have no ticketstub. Icannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by therefs. I amenraged. I have cleared out the seatsaround mebecause I keep removing my hat andbeating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concernedfan asks ifI m OK and perhaps I shouldn t take itso seriously.I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive&quot;worst fuckingcall I have EVER seen,&quot; I attempt toremove my hatagain to begin beating inanimateobjects. However, onthis occasion I miscalculate and Ithumbnail myself inmy left eyelid, leaving a one-quarterinch gash overmy eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and allover my shirt. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I think tomyself, &quot;I mtaking this a bit seriously.&quot;10:22 I am standing in the bathroompeeing. I m sodrunk I am swaying and grunting. I havea bloodynapkin pressed on my left eye. My pantsare bloody.I have my (formerly) white shirtwrapped around mywaist. I look like I should be in anepisode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloodywhite shirtback on my body and make my way for theexits. I amstopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask mewhy I amcovered in blood, but I merely gruntincoherently andkeep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I havelocated theparking garage. I walk up six flightsof stairs,promise that when I see my friend Iwill punch himin the face for making me walk up sixflights ofstairs, find the truck, and collapse ina heap in thebed of the truck. I look around andnotice thattraffic is lined up all the way aroundthe garage, sixwhole flights, and no one is moving. Itake a nap.11:17 I awake from my nap. I see myfriend in thedriver s seat. I lift my head to lookout the bed ofthe truck and notice that traffic islined up all theway around the garage, six wholeflights, and no oneismoving. I am too tired to punch myfriend. I call myfriend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:31 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:38 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:47 I lift my head to look out thebed of the truckand notice that traffic is lined up allthe way aroundthe garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving.I call my friend a &quot;Stupid fuck.&quot;11:58 I am jostled. The truck ismoving. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truckand notice thattraffic is beginning to move on thesecond floor. Ijump out of the truck, walk to the edgeof the parkingfacility, and pee off the sixth flooronto the streetbelow. My friend looks at me like Ijust anallyviolated his minor sister. I turnaround and peeon the front of his truck while singingthe lyricsto &quot;Neon Moon.&quot;12:11 We are moving. We are out ofbeer. I jumpfrom the truck and go from vehicle tovehicle untilsomeone gives me two beers. I am happy.I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parkingfacility. Wemake our way to my apartment and findEd sitting onthe couch with a freshly opened bottleof Glenlivet onthe coffee table in front of him.

Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a &quot;material adverse impact on Enron s ability to continue as a going concern,&quot; it warned.

In the nine monthssince December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. Thedecade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only fiveyears ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distantmemory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TVsets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With nodemand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer priceindex, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead andthere is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sectoris shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in humanmemory.In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried tofind a place, however humble, in the organised sector of theeconomy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risenby another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confidentthat a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all ofthe country s problems.But one recent event highlights the government s paralysis moresharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is itsfailure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of theMaharashtra State Electricity Boards s attempt to foil Enron sbid to take it before an international arbitration court byclaiming that a case was pending before an Indian courtchallenging the arbitration clause in the power purchaseagreement.The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government sinternational obligations as defined by the Treaty or theagreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,proceedings in an international court must take precedence overthose in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been clearedfor India to face the humiliation of being dragged before aninternational tribunal for a breach of it contractualobligations.Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron s lawyers, both thosewhom they retain and those who drafted the power purchaseagreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEBwill lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservativeestimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs anddamages. In addition it will have to spend a little more tocomplete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project islikely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute hasdragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this wassimply a dispute between a State Government and a privatecompany, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in anycase wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. Buttoday it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was becauseneither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the billwill, inevitably land at the Centre s door. And that means thetaxpayer s door.The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? Theanswer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do istransfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to completeand operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion powerplant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too willinsist on the capital value of the project being substantiallywritten down first. Judging from the offers that the TataElectric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity SupplyCompany (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value willnot exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, thecountry will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for thatmatter anything else) in return.None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enronprobably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Raogovernment agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor isit intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government thathad it only brought the Maharashtra government and moreparticularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginningthe latter s inability under law to pay backup charges at morethan twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plantswould have been exposed long ago.But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justifyeven greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, theEnron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As aserious, responsible government that knows the importance ofhonouring one s word in a world where contract is king, theVajpayee Government must honour the country s contractualobligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying toalter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did notsee, but by definition all future changes must be by mutualconsent.The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol s poweraffordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committeeand the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buythe $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into aseparate company that can supply gas to all the current andfuture users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one betterand bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and managethe plant. This is entirely feasible because its installedcapacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. Thiswill bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges andcost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of theequity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreignexchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicingrepresents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairmanof BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupeedebt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricitytariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oilhaving fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changeswill bring down the cost of Dabhol s power at 90 per centcapacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will makeit entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and theneighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in theaverage power tariff or are able to bring down power theft andreduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.The right course for the centre even at this late stage will beto take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it withEnron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from itat cost and make the above structural changes on its own beforehanding it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court willneither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol s power nor answerthe more basic question - how can any electricity grid add newpower plants to itself without raising the average tariff itcharges for electricity.Copyrights: 1995 - 2001 The HinduRepublication or redissemination of the contents of this screen are expresslyprohibited without the consent of The Hindu</data>

This is itsfailure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of theMaharashtra State Electricity Boards s attempt to foil Enron sbid to take it before an international arbitration court byclaiming that a case was pending before an Indian courtchallenging the arbitration clause in the power purchaseagreement.The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government sinternational obligations as defined by the Treaty or theagreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,proceedings in an international court must take precedence overthose in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been clearedfor India to face the humiliation of being dragged before aninternational tribunal for a breach of it contractualobligations.Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron s lawyers, both thosewhom they retain and those who drafted the power purchaseagreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEBwill lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservativeestimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs anddamages. In addition it will have to spend a little more tocomplete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project islikely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute hasdragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this wassimply a dispute between a State Government and a privatecompany, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in anycase wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. Buttoday it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was becauseneither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the billwill, inevitably land at the Centre s door. And that means thetaxpayer s door.The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? Theanswer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do istransfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to completeand operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion powerplant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too willinsist on the capital value of the project being substantiallywritten down first. Judging from the offers that the TataElectric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity SupplyCompany (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value willnot exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, thecountry will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for thatmatter anything else) in return.None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enronprobably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Raogovernment agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor isit intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government thathad it only brought the Maharashtra government and moreparticularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginningthe latter s inability under law to pay backup charges at morethan twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plantswould have been exposed long ago.But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justifyeven greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, theEnron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As aserious, responsible government that knows the importance ofhonouring one s word in a world where contract is king, theVajpayee Government must honour the country s contractualobligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying toalter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did notsee, but by definition all future changes must be by mutualconsent.The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol s poweraffordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committeeand the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buythe $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into aseparate company that can supply gas to all the current andfuture users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one betterand bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and managethe plant. This is entirely feasible because its installedcapacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. Thiswill bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges andcost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of theequity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreignexchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicingrepresents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairmanof BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupeedebt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricitytariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oilhaving fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changeswill bring down the cost of Dabhol s power at 90 per centcapacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will makeit entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and theneighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in theaverage power tariff or are able to bring down power theft andreduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.The right course for the centre even at this late stage will beto take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it withEnron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from itat cost and make the above structural changes on its own beforehanding it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court willneither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol s power nor answerthe more basic question - how can any electricity grid add newpower plants to itself without raising the average tariff itcharges for electricity.Copyrights: 1995 - 2001 The HinduRepublication or redissemination of the contents of this screen are expresslyprohibited without the consent of The Hindu</data>

      <data key="e_body">For the first time in 22 years of service for Enron I m ashamed to admit th=at I work for Enron!  I have lost all respect for Enron Senior Management a=nd agree with the Financial Analyst when they say that Enron Senior Managem=ent can not be trusted.  Ethics and Morals are either something everyone el=se needs to have except Senior Management or somewhere along the way Senior= Management started believing the end justifies the means.  The communicati=on the Employee s have received over the last few years about values such a=s Respect, Integrity, Communication and excellence must be propaganda inten=ded to get Employee s to believe Senior Management really supported these v=alues so that no one would really notice that their actions represented som=ething just the opposite.I can not believe that Senior Management lacks the understanding of human n=ature to totally ignore the fact that if someone does not trust what you ha=ve said in the past you should not try and conceal pertinent information in= the future.  Then to allow an Enron Spokesperson to speak for Enron with t=he statement &quot;It s just a balance-sheet issue&quot;  implies to me that this ind=ividual does not know what a Balance Sheet or Income Statement is and certa=inly should not be speaking to the public.  If you are going to play the ga=me of lying, cheating and stealing at least be intelligent enough to presen=t a plausible story.  To use phrases such as it was a hedge against fluctua=ting values in some of Enron s broadband telecommunications and other techn=ology investments is a complete insult to my intelligence and to the defini=tion of the word &quot;HEDGE&quot;.  A hedge by definition implies that the upside an=d downside exposure has been limited.  It frightens me that we are out aski=ng customers to let Enron help them &quot;HEDGE&quot; their risk when I m not sure En=ron s Senior Management understands what a hedge means?I m also confused as to the personal financial involvement of Andy Fastow i=n the investment vehicle that generated this write down.  I must be confuse=d in that as a Trader Enron has asked me to sign documents declaring that I= will not have any personal financial involvement in anything involving the= Natural Gas Business.  This must be an example of as my father used to say= &quot; do as I say not as I do&quot;? I guess we need to have audits performed of Se=nior Managements financial interest to insure their actions are as good as =their word?The fact that Senior Management and the ENE Board of Directors knew these t=ransactions were being used to manipulate earnings and the stock price and =took advantage of that knowledge to sell their ENE stock options in my opin=ion is &quot;CRIMINAL&quot;.  It provides me no comfort to know that the biggest perp=etrators of this fraud have left Enron in recent months.  These individuals= have stolen billions of dollars from ENE stockholders and Employees and ne=ed to pay the price for such fraudulent activity.  They are set for life, h=aving all the money they could ever need, while Employees and Stockholders =have lost their life savings.  You have completely failed at the job you we=re hired to perform.  If this type of activity would have occurred farther =down the organization no one would hesitate to fire the individuals involve=d and to institute criminal charges.  =20I for one can not wait until the All Employee meeting next week.  I do not =think anyone wants to hear about third quarter results because how could we= trust what is said anyway.  Instead I feel you owe the ENE Employee s a th=orough explanation of how you failed to perform your responsibilities, what= actions are going to be taken and most of all apologize for the job perfor=mance to date.=20</data>

I don t think that most people checked the bottom of the sitara deal to see that the volumes were zero for future months.  I started comparing the Bankruptcy index book to a prompt month calc. and fixed as much as I could for the East and West, I just started on Central but we should check this all again on Monday.  Because of this, we have not reported any prompt month physical value.  The rates group hasn t been around to get the demand charges either.
